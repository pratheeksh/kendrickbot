I say bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe 
I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibeLook inside my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find doubt, it never exists
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hanging with ya
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Buried on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridgeI can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check, with all disrespect let me say thisI am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibeI'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past ya
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain, stuck in a box
Ima break out and then hide every lock
Ima break out and then hide every lockI can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check, with all disrespect let me say thisI am a sinner

Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibeYou ain't heard a chorus like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
3's in the air I can see you are - in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My new year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe

So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga you made it."
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga you made it."
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga you made it."
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga I hate it."
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga I hate it."Frustrated and I'm riding down the back streets
Making my conscious ask me
"Would I survive to make it up out this hole in time?"
Black boy fly
Black boy fly
Black-black boy fly
Black boy flyI used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo
I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo
He was the one to follow
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
He would live in the gym
We was living in sorrow
Total envy of him
He made his dream become a reality
Actually making it possible to swim
His way out of Compton with further more to accomplish
Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score thirty
Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
'Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
That we was just moving backwards
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us ditching classes heading nowhere fast
Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals
He had his back like a spinal meanwhile
We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
Eleven graders gone wrong
He focused on the NBA we focused on some Patron
Now watch that black boy flyBlack boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boyI used to jealous of Jayceon
I used to jealous of Jayceon, Taylor when I was young
Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn
Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against
Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed
The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
Its 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar
For the name of The Game they line in front of the store
Swap meets selling our mixtapes I'm like oh shit, wait
Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
Mixed feelings was my opinion I was defending my insecurities
Chillin' my conscience next to a villain
Compton made you believe success wasn't real
Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal
So as I peel through these lottery tickets
I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
A tall nigga hopped out with Jordan's and a white tank top
He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
So watch that black boy flyBlack boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boyMy mama didn't raise me up to be jealous hearted
Like most of the winners call it
Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
That's what she said but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
A boy touring the country with money from mic recording
The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype
Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like top forty
And shortly, I got discouraged
Like every time I walked to the corner had them guns bursting
Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
Only one in a million will ever see better days
Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
Break your boogie boards to pieces you just a typical homie
All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
They all will buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle
When two niggas making it out had never sounded logical
Three niggas making it out, that's mission impossible
So I never believed the type of performance that I can do
I wasn't jealous 'cause of the talents they got
I was terrified they'll be the last black boys to fly
Out of ComptonThank God
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly 
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga you made it."
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga you made it."

Dick hard like Rottweiler
Can you handle it? Can you handle it? Woo woo, woo wooThe whole industry been in shambles
Everybody fugazi, I'm just changing the channel
Kendrick Lamar, the people's champion, I'm animal for analysts
Career damaging verses, meditating with candles lit
I like my raps extra prolific
Since freestyling on lunch tables and park benches
And I won't mention my ten thousand hours in training
While juggling gang-banging, my balancing was tremendous
And now we look at the competition as quick submission
They tappin' out before we even get a chance to miss 'em
What this about, is it money or skill?
Maybe it's both and I got large amounts of it, it's real
You see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakable
I can see y'all incapable
To be the God emcees, you know me well
Ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister
Run for cover, my lineage prove itself
I'm rollin' deep in that paper like two Adeles
Before scholars, I flowed tighter than virgin lips
We had to shake the game up and you're flying through turbulence
Everything is high stakes nowadays, that's how it played nowadays
It's like an 8-ball to the face nowadays
I'm laced nowadays, my gun is off the waist nowadays
It's seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays, I'm talking
Hiiigher power, every other hour since Eddie Bauer
Since stash boxes and lead showers, breaking the padlock
And the dead coward dying a thousand deaths, entire lion
Surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah!
This is what they want, I'm the one
This is vintage from 1990 - somethin'
I'm the son of the pioneer that got you niggas on
Play with him, bitch you better off voting for Donald Trump
I'm yelling Mr. Kanye West for president
He probably let me get some head inside the residence
I'm in the White House going all out
Bumping College Dropout, God-bless Americans
Nothing more influential than rap music
I merge jazz fusion with the trap music
I mix black soul with some rock and roll
They never box me in, I'm David Blaine-ing all you hoes
Oh yea, let's go there, my DNA is DMT, I'm so rare
My juvenile was wilder than the NOLA
A locomotive couldn't track me down in my career
Runnin' this shit with four pair, son of my bitch, I might demolish
A bitch right in front ya, chico, what have you done here?
D-Bo, all of it one year, Mississippi to California
It gets annoying, niggas wanna deploy him
And bitches wanna adore him, but industry shit ain't for him
Probably thinking it's for him, only one me
Swallowed the key and kicking the door in, never leasing my foreign
Mr. Valevictorian studied the game before them
Listen to you with boredom, baby rappers, abort them
To the grave I deport them, corporations extort them
I'm snapping off my endorphins, I alien mighty morphin'
My radiance rather gorgeous, hundred bill to the doorman
Hundred mil in my fortune, they call me back in the morning
You're racing against the tortoise, pace myself it's important
Lace myself with the wisdom my playerism enormous
So pay the man for performance, saucy all of my garments
Jimi Kendrix performing, this fucking studio haunted (Ah!)
I tell a bitch don't sweat me (Don't sweat me)
I kill this whole fuckin' beat if Cole let me (Please Cole)
Ib should've never sent the instrumental
Every time I start writing I get sentimental
This shit is just not fair
But why the fuck should I care?
The story of your life here
Two young stars was born and y'all gon' die here
Oh Lord, gotta be the yams
Billboard list need 2Pac, damn
But number 9 makes sure he lives on, yeah
Hoochie, coochie, pussies in a trance
Every day a celebration, but even the valley peaking me
Is not validation, nigga this TDE
And my doggies be salivating, salaries, better ratings
And casualties all around me, don't make me do demonstrations
Whoa
Murder my allegations and burning my finger traces
Adjourning my power patience and earning royalty payments
I'm sorry y'all not relating, this party is reservated
I kill this whole muthafucking beat if J. Cole say it
My nigga Ib chopped the instrumental, I gotta slay it
I gotta lay it, gotta show you fuckers I'm not to play with
The ruckus had been my favorite, King Kunta the fuckin' greatest
Whoa
Burnin' my leather-
(Nah I'm just fuckin' wit cha)

Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?So I was takin' a walk the other day
And I seen a woman, a blind woman
Pacin' up and down the sidewalk
She seemed to be a bit frustrated
As if she had dropped somethin' and
Havin' a hard time findin' it
So after watchin' her struggle for a while
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?"Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance?
It seems to me that you have lost something
I would like to help you find it"She replied:
"Oh yes, you have lost something. You've lost your life."Is it wickedness?Uh, Lamar stated his views
Uh, Lamar stated his views
Uh, Lamar stated his views
Uh, Lamar stated his viewsUh, Lamar stated his views on police brutality with that line in the song
Quote: "And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'"
Oh please, ugh, I don't like it

[Kendrick]
2 tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford!
I could never put my plans to the side with you!
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with the headlight
I freeze up when I reupSee I barely had patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
Went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came, checks didn't hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I could shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrowBut why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
They say I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
Walking around with them blue faces
I hit the bank today and tell them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me downMy home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don't give a damn
Intuition got a black woman wishin'
She sayin' this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, hoping you could make it
Women don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
Can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all themBut why I'm so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
They say I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
Walking around with them blue faces
I hit the bank today and tell them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me downI love god, I love speed, I love drank, I love me
I love oceans in the deep, I love me
I love women, I love me
I love God
But I'm scared of god speed
SometimesWrote this song like I never went home and made it
You know the poverty stricken the lyrical broke boy and baby
Somebody say Kendrick American they sho' is crazy
And I said "why?"
The he looked me in the eye
He said homie you messed up
You breaking my good luck
You wishing for miracles
Living through shit, you're crying hysterical
Settle for everything, complain about everything
Say your soul crack, my world amphetamines
You projects ain't it, I live in the hood
You living to keep warm
I'm living to pay rent
I paid my way through
Praying to Allah
You played your way through dealing with Wi-Fi
Go fuck yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing go for the ones you came with
We all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you're looking for dope
These days ain't no compromise
Your pain ain't mine half the time
A brand new excuse ain't nothing to me
See I made my moves, with shackled feetCape Town, Cape Town, Cape Town, Cape Town
Cape Town, Cape Town, Cape TownCorn row kenny
I wanna get the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrr
I wanna get the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrr, skrr
Corn row kenny
So many plays on me I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I react
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil
A father figure play with him, he get killed
Play with me and he will kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juggin' like that
Act of violence, yeah, we juggin' like that
I did a lot of dumb things in my past
Love will give me hope and I won't relapse
Dave just bought a new nine eleven
Almost thought I'd seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Rashad got his son dripping in gold
Me I'm 'bout to let my hair down the holes
Ali 'bout to let his hair down the holes
Top billing that's a million a show
Might blow the [?] Soul
Might tell Obama be more like Punch
Sounwave got a Grammy this year
Mack [?], but he do what he wantLevel two, level two
No I'm not done
You ain't gotta tell me that I'm the one
I could put a rapper on life support
Guarantee something that none of you want
Then hold me down and they yell something like
Rent is like twenty five hundred a month
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
You ain't gotta tell me that I'm the one
You ain't gotta tell me that I'm the one
You ain't gotta tell me that I'm the one
You ain't gotta tell me that I'm the one
You ain't got, you ain't got
You ain't got, you ain't
You ain't gotta tell me that I'm the one
Yes I'm the one 
If you was in a pine box
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in and fall asleep
Cause you are the death of meIf you was in a pine box (box)
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in and, and fall asleep I fall asleep
Cause you are the death of me, cause you are the
The, the death of me, the death of meLooking in the mirror I'm embarrassed
I'm feeling like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man arm wrestling hands I was dealt
When I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that would keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar women love when you're my type
And you're winning from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel
Live the ambiance all cause the audience, one day said I would do it
So instead of a verse being read
I'mma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat
Capitalize That, and your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Tracking device on your used 5 series
I don't call back just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto, hit me on the cellular
Thought he was gonna sell me a false word like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors all that nigga was missing was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation, a reality living in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we making
Then he said that he was the same age as.. myself
And it didn't help cause it made me even more rude an impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO, the reason why I'm breathing all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why, the highlight was when he said,
You belong to the people when you outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy, full of fame
And bury yourself alive, then I died 
[Intro]
I wanna hit line drives...
Wanna lose weight and keep eating...
For you...
Hey, whats up doc?
[Bridge]
Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you, I wonder what's that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized I-I-I had something to prove
You told me "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the road
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar and Gunplay]
And I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!), and I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it, (Yeah! Blow!), and I run it, (Yeah! Blow!)
That's ironic, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!), I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
That's ironic, (Y-Yeah! Blow!), I run it, (Yeah! Blow! Yeah!)
Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth
Just for you, mothafucka, hope y'all amused
And I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!), and I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it, (Y-Yeah! Blow!), and I run it (Yeah! Blow!) That's ironic
[Interlude]
Liberation...leader...
Popular pie plant pictured here...
Wile E. Coyote! Wile E. Coyote!
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
This shit make a nigga just wanna write
Reminisce when I had the morning appetite
Apple Jacks and after that I hit the TV Guide
Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
Im a maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
Tell a story that I'll never glory 25
Not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria
And that's a covenant I put on every tribe
Ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe
Nobody gon' abide by your rule
Nobody holding your gun, how come your tongue say killa then kill my mood
Light speed living in the world you know
Little old me, feeling like a live wire
Bet I put some new tires on a lighting bolt
Til' I wreck into a pole, like a right to vote
I am from the bottom of the jungle
Living in the bottom of the food chain
When you get a new chain, nigga take it from you
A new name, want stripes, and you and zebra look alike
Hope another homicide don't numb you and none do
Things we will never learn soon
In the era where we wanna earn soon
That's a error, you can smell it in the air and everybody really doomed
That's why I'm backdooring you motherfuckas
All y'all can suck my dick
All them days at the county building
Now I'm 'bout to make my mama rich
Cartoons and (cereal!) I ain't felt this good since
Scrooge McDuck, (here we go!) Elementary hood shit
[Bridge + Hook]
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
This shit make a nigga just wanna shit on everybody
Even with a pot to piss in
I'mma aim sloppy at a loud mouth, discharge
Dismiss any business of yours
Discounts never did amount to a check
That ya ass couldn't cash when the shit bounce
Everything dismounts, niggas gon' flip that car
AKs for the whole hood
House lick went down perfect
Two shots to the head he deserved it
Overheard it hit my bed with a bowl and remote control
Dark Wing Duck lost service
Mama said I'd better duck, she's nervous
Drama all up in the cut, hit the curtains
I mean don't intervene with no gun machine
This block stay jerking, the feds stay lurkin'
Emerging on everbody corner (dash for it)
Get a toe tag when you play tag with a task of a new (task force)
Everybody wanna know my life
How did I make it (passed yours)
Well let me tell you like this
I've been running this shit since (I asked for it)
Cartoons and cereal
[Bridge]
[Verse 3: Gunplay]
Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth just for you
Mufucka hope y'all amused!
I did wrong, karma came
Crackers gave me ball and chain
Friends, enemies all the same
State, fed, both can hang
Nobody can mute me, but I never said nobody can't shoot me
Just another stat to the white folks
Still whip work to the white yolk, absolutely!
Everyday feel like the one before
Hunt the money, don't hunt the ho
If you do what you always done
Then you get what you always got
You dumb buffoons!
I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
For about the past 72 hours
Hand on my heart, face to the hood
I pledge every word you ever heard was honest
Yeah this me, no mic
No cameras, no lights, just pain
Mama how much trauma can I sustain?
Dirty money come with lots of stains
Road to riches come with lots of lanes
Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit, got lots to gain...
Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit, got lots to gain

When the sun fall out the sky
All I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
Now, that's the ultimate high
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me ya need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
Two time, baby tell me ya love me
Cause I've been drinking too much, thinking too much
We ain't been keeping in touch
Fell into lust, where is the love?
My independency got tendencies of lack of trust
I look at the street corners as my new woman
Seductive as you want to be, hands on my garments
And luckily, being in denial ain't the case
Cause I know she's unfaithful
Instead I'm grabbing her waist
And every part of her is tasteful
I know you're feelings hating
In fact, you think I'm ungrateful. I know
Selfish as I wanna be and every time you under me
I get the vibe you might need some time to grow
[Hook]
Cause I been drinking too much, thinking too much
We ain't been keeping in touch
And every time that I think of your touch
Adrenaline pump, give me that rush
I'm going like a thief inside the wind
Lord forgive me for my sins
I know she want me more, but I feen for benjamins
She said I found the root of all evil
And lost a friend
Lost in the world of a young boy from Compton
That never knew love because love was never promised
I know. selfish as I wanna be
And every time I'm under you, me too
Need time to grow.

Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truthMomma take this mothafuckin' block off
Tryna reach you everyday, collect calls
Never get through, and I go through withdrawals
Say who told you that I wanted this door
To slam shut, I just wanted to vent or
Ask you if you give me your rent for
A attorney, I can pay you back more
Soon as I get out, yea every rack is yours
Commissary running low, I need help
Not too much, I hustle up the rest myself
K Dot wrote me saying Marcus got killed
If you knew me, then you know how bad I feel
Quisha prove me wrong, and never came to visit
And I heard she fucking on some other nigga
And my niggas left me in the dark, blind
Mama just get back at me this last timeMen lie, women lie, men lie, women lie
Men lie, women lie, men lie, women lie
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truthMama take this mothafuckin' block off
That's on the date the day I take the block off
Pulled up, and they put me in them cop cars
Please believe me, this ain't easy by far
You forgot you're talking to your only son
Remember when you put me in that relay run
I was racing, chasing dreams to be the best
You had taught me that the very day I won
All I need is you to give me same support
Investigation saying that the same report
From a witness just might testify in court
DA say I take a deal, or take a loss
I ain't built for all them goddamn numbers
God's will, say a prayer for me mama
If you can't, then open up the phone lines
Mama just get back at me this last timeMen lie, women lie, men lie, women lie
Men lie, women lie, men lie, women lie
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truthDante, if I stress to take the block off
That's the day the state had take them locks off
I could only help but do so much
Bettering yourself, your own crutch
Look at your reflection tell me who you see
Who is your protection, G-O-D
No it's not neglection, I have just accepted
Your fate, then what its gon' be
Remember all the nights that I cried
Thinking that my only son just died
Peeking through the window, kicking through the door
It's you they looking for, raid outside
Rather see you locked up than dead
Only you would say that I'm selfish
So before I take the stand, and put this Bible in my hand
Son, let me say thisMen lie, women lie, men lie, women lie
Men lie, women lie, men lie, women lie
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth

So I'mma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces
Then wit told me, "You're womanless, women love the creation"
It all came from God then you was my confirmation
I came to where you reside

Keep your head up, when did you stop? Love and die
Color of your skin, color of your eyes
That's the real blues, baby, like you met Jay's baby
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue green and grey
All my Solomon up north, 12 years a slave
12 years of age, thinkin' my shade too dark
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid
And forcin' my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light don't mean you smart, bein' dark don't make you stupid
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain't talkin' "Woohah!"
Need a paradox for the pair of dots they tutored
Like two ties, L-L, you lose two times
If you don't see you beautiful in your complexion
It ain't complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, that's the context
Yeah, baby, I'm conscious, ain't no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain't no stress, jigga boos wanna be
I ain't talkin' Jay, I ain't talkin' Bey
I'm talkin' days we got school watchin' movie screens
And spike yourself esteem
The new James Bond gon' be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it's all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain't a thingBarefoot babies with no cares
Teenage gun toters that don't play fair, should I get out the car?
I don't see Compton, I see something much worse
The land of the landmines, the hell that's on earth

Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar
This is king Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant at 5 in the morning
They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing
And if they take everything, know I gotCompton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine(Ay, Dre what's happenin' wit' it my nigga!)Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
With a batch of them bangin' Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthin' this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm fromCompton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mineSo come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga
Kendrick Conan nigga
Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tatsWill swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the East side
Know that's just how Compton rollAnd that's a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it
(Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record
Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in)Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mineSo tell that gangster throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I'mma take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye
Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standbyCompton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mineNow we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of NWA
America target our rap market, it's controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich, and the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers that know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rozay
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every motherfucker in here say:
"Look who's responsible for taking Compton international
I make 'em holla"Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah
In the city of Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine 
(Intro)
Yeah, Kendrick Lamar. This is for the town nigga!(Verse 1)
Me I'm from the hub city Yeah that compton court building
Caught a murder when his homie died Judge Caught Feelings
Im on Rosecrans chilling right inside best outlest
Five dollar Little Caesar Momma shopped at Food for less
Elementary McNair say whats up to Vanguard
Centennial high, had me swimming with a pool of sharks
Me I'm just a good kid trying to keep it neutral
But Im well aware that a square can get shot too
Most Crip and some Piru thats just how the game go
Hood on every corner stop for gas and get your brains blown
Bitches with fat asses burning in the stashes
Murders in July call that summer time madness
Rest in peace 4bent rest in peace moss-berg
Swear to god when I make it big yo voice will be heard
Me Im just a good kid trying to keep it positive
Though I know its chaos forever my heart will live in...(Chorus)
Compton, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in Compton
These streets will make you or break you
Expire or inspire you
Let's hear it for Compton, Compton, Compton(Verse 2)
Take you back to Y.E.T it was just divining me
Earl had got disciplined for not catching a fade that week
Shit had made him stronger though, yeah those were the good old days
Eating Tam's burger while my Juvenile CD had played
21 outside maybe sideline pop
Yellow tape on sidewalk damn somebody got popped
Hoping that I live a lot, I don't want to die young
Please don't come shoot up my party, I just want to have fun
Sheriffs in my rear view, mother fuck the police
Pull me over just to plant an 8 ball on me
Fuck it though I'm out here, I've always been out here
Since the Compton swap meet, black and red LA gears
Pac was on Rosecrans nigga I was right there
Cali Love video he said whattup I said yeah

But I'm pushing to get us there in no time

Word to the county building forever I do it for...(Chorus)(Outro)
[My nigga Hootie told me to keep it Compton, keep it Compton yeah
E-S-T 1987, Dominguez Hospital that bitch was on Bullis Road] 
Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar
This is king Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant at 5 in the morning
They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing
And if they take everything, know I gotCompton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine(Ay, Dre what's happenin' wit' it my nigga!)Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
With a batch of them bangin' Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthin' this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm fromCompton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mineSo come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga
Kendrick Conan nigga
Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tatsWill swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the East side
Know that's just how Compton rollAnd that's a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it
(Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record
Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in)Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mineSo tell that gangster throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I'mma take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye
Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standbyCompton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mineNow we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of NWA
America target our rap market, it's controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich, and the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers that know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rozay
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every motherfucker in here say:
"Look who's responsible for taking Compton international
I make 'em holla"Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah
In the city of Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine 
 
I look up
Yeah and I take my time nigga
I'mma take my time, woah
Power moves onlyBoy I'm 'bout my business on business
I drink liquor on liquor
I had women on women
Yeah that's bunk bed bitches
I've done lived more than an eighty year old man still kickin'
Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls that barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit
They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall bitch like a drought but
You gon' get this rain like it's May weather
G.O.O.D. Music, Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid then reverse debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
So I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind
In my mind, but fuck tryin' and not doin'
Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that Juicy vid bitch
I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'
Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-
Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like AK was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah I know that shit ain't fair
They say that Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew that the world was for the taking and it wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit versus everybody
I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because I'm name droppin'
Hall of Fame droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OG's
Cause that ain't the way of an OG
So I G-O collect more G's, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me
Forever hot headed but never got cold feet
Got up in the game won't look back at my old seats
Clique so deep we take up the whole street
I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week, Sean DonMiscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds
Devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond
Peddlin' sin, thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize
I'm not gonna fold or demise
(I don't smoke crack, motherfucker I sell it!)
Bitch, everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon
So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
Don't pop me no fucking pill, I'mma a pop you and give you thisTell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm like Vietnam in this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line 'em up and bomb on they mom
While she watchin' the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the pope, I'm a muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the king of New York
King of the Coast, one hand, I juggle them both
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends I'm in Vegas
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin' me
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable
Fuck y'all clubs, fuck y'all pictures, your Instagram can gobble these nuts
Gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch
I've seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons
Mollies'll prolly turn these niggas to fuckin' Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich ass white girls lookin' for parties
Playin with Barbies, wreck the Porsche before you give 'em the car key
Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley
(I don't smoke crack motherfucker I sell it)
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aimin' straight for your pelvis, you can't stomach me
You plan on stumpin' me? Bitch I've been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas, climbing 100 mil in front of me
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
Bout who's the best MC? Kendrick, Jigga and Nas
Eminem, Andre 3000, the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rockin no more designer shit
White T's and Nike Cortez, this is red Corvettes anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhymin' wit
But this is hip hop and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big KRIT, Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all but I'm tryna murder you niggas
