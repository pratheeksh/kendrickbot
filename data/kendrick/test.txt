(Intro)
Yeah, Kendrick Lamar. This is for the town nigga!(Verse 1)
Me I'm from the hub city Yeah that compton court building
Caught a murder when his homie died Judge Caught Feelings
Im on Rosecrans chilling right inside best outlest
Five dollar Little Caesar Momma shopped at Food for less
Elementary McNair say whats up to Vanguard
Centennial high, had me swimming with a pool of sharks
Me I'm just a good kid trying to keep it neutral
But Im well aware that a square can get shot too
Most Crip and some Piru thats just how the game go
Hood on every corner stop for gas and get your brains blown
Bitches with fat asses burning in the stashes
Murders in July call that summer time madness
Rest in peace 4bent rest in peace moss-berg
Swear to god when I make it big yo voice will be heard
Me Im just a good kid trying to keep it positive
Though I know its chaos forever my heart will live in...(Chorus)
Compton, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in Compton
These streets will make you or break you
Expire or inspire you
Let's hear it for Compton, Compton, Compton(Verse 2)
Take you back to Y.E.T it was just divining me
Earl had got disciplined for not catching a fade that week
Shit had made him stronger though, yeah those were the good old days
Eating Tam's burger while my Juvenile CD had played
21 outside maybe sideline pop
Yellow tape on sidewalk damn somebody got popped
Hoping that I live a lot, I don't want to die young
Please don't come shoot up my party, I just want to have fun
Sheriffs in my rear view, mother fuck the police
Pull me over just to plant an 8 ball on me
Fuck it though I'm out here, I've always been out here
Since the Compton swap meet, black and red LA gears
Pac was on Rosecrans nigga I was right there
Cali Love video he said whattup I said yeah
Free my nigga J-Dub and both of the J-Mans
Eazy paved the way, Lil Eazy bout to get it in for..(Chorus)(Verse 3)
I'm talking bout Westside Piru, N.H.P., Campanella, Carver Park
Front Hood, Nutty Blocc, Lantana, 151, Park Village
Cedar Block, Santana
Burgundy and Blue bandanas
Peace! Peace!
Fruit Town, Kelly Park, Southside, Elm Street
Poccet Hood, ATF, MOB, LPP, 135, VTP
Atlantic Drive, Limehood, NHC, PBC
Peace! Peace!
Tragniew, Compton Raymonds, Tree-Top, Mona Park, T Flats, 7 Os, 155
Compton Swamps, Holly hood, T Zones
All a nigga really want for us to keep
Peace! Peace!
But shit that a take some time and more time
But I'm pushing to get us there in no time
Me, I'm just a good kid hoping I can spread love
Word to the county building forever I do it for...(Chorus)(Outro)
[My nigga Hootie told me to keep it Compton, keep it Compton yeah
E-S-T 1987, Dominguez Hospital that bitch was on Bullis Road] 
Love's gonna get you killed
But pride's gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me andIt wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I careHell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldy possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart
You love 'em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in the perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics hoping I make amend
I understand I ain't perfect
I probably won't come around
This time, I might put you down
Last time, I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I'm willing to give up a leg and arm and show empathy from
Pity parties and functions and you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecureIt wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I careMaybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't thereNow, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December, but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point, nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, worldIt wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I careMaybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there 
New Kung Fu Kenny

Bunch of criminals and money in my phone calls, ay
We okay, we let the A1 fly
Relocate, jump on the same G5
Checkin' for me heavy 'cause I go yeah, I go yeah
They never been readyâyeah, I know yeah, know yeah
100K spread 'cross the floor, 'cross the floor, yeah
None of y'all fuckin' with the flow yeah, the flow yeah
Years in the makin', and don't y'all mistake it
I got 'em by a landslide, we talkin' about races
You know this'll never be a tie, just look at they laces
You know careers take off, just gotta be patient
Mr. One through Five, that's the only logic
Fake my death, go to Cuba, that's the only optionIf I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy

Goddamn us all if you won't
Damn, damn, damn, it's a goddamn shame
You ain't frontline, get out the goddamn wayNiggas thought they wasn't gonna see me, huh?
Niggas thought that K-Dot real life
Was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real
Most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference between black artists and wack artistsIf I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
(It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri)
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element 
I got, I got, I got, I got
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition, flow, inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this
Immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this
Was Yeshua's new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got
Realness, I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome, heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you
This is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids
And I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier's DNA
Born inside the beast
My expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to
Antisocial, extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And that's a riff, gonna plead this case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet sayI got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
(This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage
To young African Americans than racism in recent years)
I live a better, fuck your life
(5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the makin' of marriagesTell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you're in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows, I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murderâthese are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murderâour DNA 
Said I'm a fuckin' monster
A massive attack I haunt 'ya
Mastered the rap then fucked up the monitors
Mastered that after that I went for thermometors
Popped em all,then popped in the jaw of Tracy Veronica
Holla back they promised us
No pajamas insomnia will attack I attack like pirahna does
Hit yo block like a comet , BLAHH! and you all know what time it is
2012 mark 'ya calendars calisthenics and silencers exercisin' that trigger strip
Rock with us Metallica; competition no talented
I'm in a jungle whats wild enough
Just might stumble upon a pack of lions
No lyin' my soilders dyin' this is Iraq
Alliances lining wit stars and bars of a prison wreck
My science applyin pressure her strecher is needed pay the proceeds
Or your livin debt y'all soft as a giga-pet
You niggas can't see me unless you watchin the tv or ultra huggin my silhouette
My flow got the ceiling wet
I spit til I feel my breath
Who sinkin my fuckin chest
She fuckin the fuckin best
Mean my dick is the dick of death
Means I'm killin that pussy
Like Spike whenever that Jerry slept
Yaaa Dre

Whether you storm to your climate
Whether your beat makin or rhyming
Bumpin some Phyllis Hyman
Hand full of diamonds like Jay fans
On a island wit Ray Bans
Glasses palmin' asses that probably came wit a great tan
{laughs}
I be the mother fuckin mecca of these hub city spectrum
Where they at I will disect them like a fucking frog rectum
Why you wreckin wit a reticle my word flow incredible

Etcetera etcetera Bentley passin up Celicas
They tellin us about shit, high power in ya mouth bitch
And Top Dawg can vouch bitch
Nigga what you bout , about face wit army outfits
The generals here
That mean the hustlers and the criminals here
Penitence reachin pinacles of life and despair and me I solemnly swear to handle mine like a Taliban and die for it
Only difference is I ain't never askin Allah for it
Only difference is I be spazzin and still apply for it
Put me in a category
I don't know what's a sadder story
Guts and glory
Your pain bore me you ain't really lived it
I take you to a block where they Crippin
Or Piru that 5'2 gun bigger than the torso of Pippen
Bitch I been doin before you niggas ruined it
Show me somethin different

You live in a disrict of dimebags and dummys I know your statistics

[Kendrick]
The whole industry been in shambles!
Everybody fugazi
I'm just changin' the channel!Kendrick Lamar
The people's champion
I'm animal for analystsCareer damaging verses, meditating with candles lit
I like my raps extra prolific
Since freestyling on lunch tables and park benches
And I won't mention my ten thousand hours in training
While juggling gang, bangin'
My balancing was tremendous
And now we look at the competition as quick submission
They tappin' out before we even get a chance to miss 'em
What this about, is it money or skill!?
Maybe it's both and I got large amounts of it, it's real
You see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakableI can see y'all incapableTo be the God emcees, you know me well
Ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister
Run for cover, my lineage prove itself
I'm rollin' deep in that paper like two Adeles
Before scholars, I flowed tighter than virgin lips
We had to shake the game up and you're flying through turbulence
Everything is high stakes nowadays, that's how it played nowadays
It's like an 8-ball to the face nowadays
I'm laced nowadays, my gun is off the waist nowadays
It's seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays, I'm talking
Higher power, every other hour since Eddie Bauer
Since stash boxes and lead showers, breaking the padlock
And the dead coward dying a thousand deaths, entire lion
Surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah!
This is what they want, I'm the one
This is vintage from 1980 - somethin'
I'm the son of the pioneer that got you niggas on
Play with him, bitch you better off voting for Donald Trump
I'm yelling Mr Kanye West for president
He probably let me get some head inside the residence
I'm in the White House goin' all out
Bumping College Dropout, God-bless Americans
Nothing more influential than rap music
I merge jazz fusion with the trap music
I mix black soul with some rock and roll
They never box me in, I'm David Blaine-ing all you hoes
Oh yea, let's go there, my DNA is DMT, I'm so rare
My jewelry now is wilder than the new year
A locomotive couldn't track me down in my cobra
Runnin' this shit with four pair, son of my bitch, I might demolish
A bitch right in front ya, chico, what have you done here?
D-Bo, all of it one year, Mississippi to California
It get annoying, niggas wanna deploy him
And bitches wanna adore him, but industry shitting for him
Probably thinking it's for him, only one me
Swallowed the key and kicking the door in, never leasing my foreign
Mr. Valedictorian studied the game before them
Listen to you with boredom, baby rappers, support them
To the grave I deport them, corporations extort them
I'm snapping off my endorphins, I alien mighty morphin'
My radius rather gorgeous, hundred bill to the doorman
Hundred mil in my fortune, they call me back in the morning
You're racing against the tortoise, pace myself it's important
Lace myself with the wisdom my playerism enormous
So pay the man for performance, saucy all of my garments
Jimi Kendrix performing, this fucking studio haunted
I tell a bitch don't sweat me
I kill this whole fuckin' beat if Cole let me
Ib should've never sent the instrumental
Every time I start writing I get sentimental
This shit is just not fair
But why the fuck should I care?
The story of your life here
Two young stars was born and y'all gon' die here
Oh Lord, gotta be the yams
Billboard list need 2Pac damn
But number 9 makes sure he lives on, yeah!
Hoochie, coochie, pussies in a tranceEvery day a celebration, but even the valley peaking me
Is not validation, nigga this TDE
And my doggies be salivating, salaries, better ratings
And casualties all around me, don't make me do demonstrations
Whoa
Murder my allegations and burning my finger traces
Adjourning my power patience and earning royalty payments
I'm sorry y'all not relating, this party is reservated
I kill this whole muthafucking beat if J. Cole say it
My nigga Ib chopped the instrumental, I gotta slay it
I gotta lay it, gotta show you fuckers I'm not to play with
The ruckus had been my favorite, King Kunta the fuckin' greatest
Whoa
Burnin' my leather...
(Nah I'm just fuckin' with ya) 
Fuck that, eight doobies to the face
Fuck that nigga twelve bottles in the case nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half, wait nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't existMan, I swear my nigga trippin off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in
Cold water, then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
Hope to take the pain away
From the feeling that he feel today
You know when you part of section 80
And you feeling like no one can relate
'Cause you are, you are
A loner, loner
Marijuana, endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like its water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, no wonder our lives is caught up in the daily superstition
That the world is bout to end who gives a fuck? we never do listen
Unless it comes with an 808, a melody and some hoes
Playstation and some drank, technology bumping soul
Looking around and all I see is a big crowd, that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, the president is black
She black too purple label on her back but that dap
is light blue, she take it straight to the head
Then she look at me, she got ADHDEight doobies to the face
Fuck that nigga twelve bottles in the case nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half, wait nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist like whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoaAnd then she started
And then she started feeling herself like no on else in this apartment
Beg you pardon oh I rap baby, how old are you?
She say 22, I say 23 OK then we all crack babies
Damn, why you say that?
She said where my drink at?
I'mma tell you later, just tell your neighbors have the police relax
I stood up, shut the blinds closed the screen, Jumbotron
Made it to the back, where she reside
Then she said, read between the lines
Yep, hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up when the new flow start to drown
Her body and I, know the both of us really deep in the move now
It's nothing we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound
Of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me then looked
At it, then she grabbed it then she said, get it understood
You know why we crack babies
Because we born in the 80s that ADHD crazyEight doobies to the face
Fuck that nigga twelve bottles in the case nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half, wait nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist like whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoaYou can have all my shine

Double cup, deuce, four, six

Ecstasy, shrooms, blow, dro, hoes

Behind my side we lookin' at you from the face down
What mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin'! And let me tell you bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
What pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my mama I love her but this what I like
Lord knows, 20 of 'em in my Chevy
Tell 'em all to come and get me, reapin' everything I sow
So my karma come and Heaven no preliminary hearing
So my record and my motherfucking gang can stand in silence for the record
Tell the world I know it's too late
The hoes, the girls think I gone crazy
Try and fight my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I sayWhen you know, we been hurt, been down before, nigga
When my pride was low, lookin' at the world like, "where do we go, nigga?"
And we hate Popo, wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga

My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow but we gon' be alrightNigga, we gon' be alright

40 acres and a mule, a piano a guitar
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it I know when it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinkin' of my partner put the candy, paint it on the regal
Diggin' in my pocket ain't a profit, big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I see cool
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog that's all
Pick back and chat I shut the back for y'all
I rap, I'm black, on track and rest assured
My rights, my wrongs are right till I'm right with GodWhen you know, we been hurt, been down before, nigga
When my pride was low, lookin' at the world like, "where do we go, nigga?"

Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alrightI keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid, a lot of changes
I'm alright and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayersI remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers 
I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibeLook inside my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find doubt, it never exists
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hanging with ya
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Buried on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridgeI can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check, with all disrespect let me say thisI am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibeI'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past ya
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain, stuck in a box
Ima break out and then hide every lock
Ima break out and then hide every lockI can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check, with all disrespect let me say thisI am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibeYou ain't heard a chorus like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
3's in the air I can see you are - in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My new year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe

It feels like I only go backwards, lately
Every part of me says go ahead
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards darlingAnd we'll be screamin' out no rules, no rules
Feel the energy we go through, I told you
Pump my fist like I'm supposed to, I showed you
My vision of the unsocial, it's so cool
Look around me and you'll see the scene, who to blame?
See my generation has no shame, I play the game
How I see it this is inside the future, this is nothin' that you're used to
I refuse to play the victim, my religion is to move ya
Out your power position, my army head-on collision
Can't harm me out of my own skin, government need assistance
Every time that I zone in, nothing is more convincin'
Than tellin' you that I won't bend, break or fake partition
I can't, this is my life design, this is me taking minds
This is what I live for, this is me takin' yours
This is more than C4, this is what happens when
We ready to build and destroy, I hope that you enjoyIt feels like I only go backwards, lately
Every part of me says go ahead
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards darlingI live my life a rebel, a vigilante, devils try to get at me
Pedal through this underworld, undertakers won't catch me
System ain't no system for justice if you would ask me
I'll tell you everything is corrupted, don't you walk past me
With the condescended look I can tell you're pretendin'
Like you my friends and you just a henchman, I feel relentless
I feel the tension in the air thick enough to cut through it
Or cut you with it I'm cut from a cloth that bred a nuisance
Trespass on your property I am properly aimin' to go against ya democracy
This is me changing faces
'Cause I can stand alone and die alone as long as I got pride
The victory of fight is all in my eyes
The night is young and I can see your demise, I'm waitin' for it
You can't ignore it, you live dormant, I die enormous
Big as the lies you tell I can tell you feel defeated
The truth will set you free and to me that's the only reason, capisce? 
'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood(Hey!) Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood(Hey!) Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shining now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak baby I couldn't breathe
I rubbed it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
You and I'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood(Hey!) Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood(Hey!) Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds they last and they last
Now did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't
So if you come in my way, just don't
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
You and I'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood(Hey!) Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood(Hey!) Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts (Ghosts)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (Hey!)
You say sorry just for show (Hey!)
You live like that, you live with ghosts (Hey!)
Hm, if you love like that blood runs bad'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby now we got bad blood(Hey!) Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them (Think we can solve them)
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood('Cause now we got bad blood) 'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done (Look at what you've done)
'Cause baby now we got bad blood (Woah)
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood (Hey!) 
[Verse 1]
When I jumped off the porch I was forced into last resorts of a typical short
And of course when that took it's course -- hoarse when yelling out
Demons that fought inside of me taught society how to rejoice
Killers on side of me, privacy obviously was lost
For a piracy of the streets and my Odyssey
Caught a bullet that probably destroyed...
A good kid in a mad city, slightly annoyed
I walk down the street with no heat and run into beef when I'm just a vegan
Reeking the scent of a saint, sinners smell it then start squeezing
Pellets tumbling straight at my melon, apparent reason...
Because my cousin's cuzzin a Blood
That was Blooding in public and Kendrick seen with him last weekend, cousin
But you ain't no kin to me, probably Kendrick I'm Kennedy
Assassinate my character, shoot as your remedy
Fair enough I got enemies but I don't bang
But that's the repercussion like when your cousin's cousin a blood
And you're by yourself at the Compton parade
Good Kid
M.A.A.D City
Life or death
Is you with me?
Wassup 
[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Uh, Most of these niggas shouldn't be next to us
We keep our distance from those, those acting like hoes
Zany imposed, weed in my clothes, cubics is gold
Ya wig'll get told, put the realest niggas
Niggas, product of cap pillers, gangbangers and dealers
Streets keep watching, aye, [click](undefined) boom the ghetto bird ya shot down
Straight to the top now, they want a third strike on my [background](undefined)
But nah homie, put the mask on when I [slide](undefined) on 'em
Put the [cash](undefined) in the safe and here's a extra slug 'for I shake
Ya smoke faster than me with a eighth
Or better yet a [wet](undefined) break on a plate
Burning ya faith, all senses covered in tape
Fuckin' with them boys in blue, chill out 'for rags at you
You running to the cops saying: How we do?
Saying it's just rap and them lines ain't true
So I just threw Q, fuck it, menage a two or maybe trois
Baby girl need a [pot](undefined) pie, I be her da da
Coochie smacking, give praise to Allah
Get blazed in my car, Oxymoron[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Rock got it, rock came from rock bottom
Sparked the flames, still remain as a top shotta
I ain't no backpack rapper, I ain't no lyricist
And if he ain't talking to you mind ya business then
Cold with it, Black Hippie, yeah we cold niggas
All the girlies love us, get a whiff of us
They bones quiver, heard some clown throwing stones at us
Holding boulders champ once you hear that YAWK. watching domes shatter
It's Top Dawg we runnin' rap, whack rappers, feline
Reason why we don't run with cats, nine double O five nine -
Where my family at
Pull up in that [family van](undefined) holding 2's like the handyman
And to be real not with all this rapping politickin'
Rapper competition, wrapped up my position
'Til I'm finished, 'Til I make a couple tickets
Then I'm outtie on them islands with my crimmies chillin'
Hide ya feelings, now can I [live](undefined)?
Look I gotta keep my feet on top of the dirt
'Cause everywhere I go they like when you dropping some work?
Been a threat since birth
The rap game's pallbearer when I'm droppin' the Hearst
I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
Industry's nightmare, red strings in my Nike Air's
Yeah, the white pair, I'm Jay Rock, America's most wanted
My chargers? Killing MC's without warning
Rock![Verse 3: Ab Soul]
It's Ab-Soul, gimme the loot, I'm the skinny Biggie
In New York City with Puffy, puffing the sticky
All eyes against me, still even the score
Prolly why I'm always OT on tour
TDE, believe me we want war
I don't even know what piece I like most no more
Two fingers, Two triggers, What's the difference?
We all gon' die one day until then I'm gettin' paid
My grandma watching so I ain't gon' curse
Still gifted like a Wale verse, backwood full of OG
Bobby Johnson medicine in my soul to trynna dodge the coffin, Ah
And these days are so [bitter sweet](undefined)
I guess it's just a balance we battle naturally
And y'all still trippin' off of Jay-Z tweets
I still got laps to run when me and Jay-Z meet
Peep Soul brother number 2
The first one used to make beats for CL Smooth
Top got the s550 but the CL smooth
And rolling weed is the only time I see L's move
Soul![Verse 4: Isaiah Rashad]
Ay, I think I found my second home
Sunny California and it's ya little nigga brother
You ain't meant for corners, it's what they told me
So I never looked back, I got a slut in the [back](undefined)
[Fattest](undefined) [elephant](undefined) ass, so we flirt in the path
Passing propellers I tell her, tell her we flying just listen
See we [diamond](undefined) just shining and they gon' find us glistening
Brought sand to the beach and we left with ya bitchh
For the [record](undefined) in Guinness I'm a hecklin' menace
Where is Robin, I'm Given'
Fuckin' minding my business
He a regular victim, us regular in women
Uh, regular niggas, you always cater to sluts
You always wasting my time, you always faking the funk
I'm put ya muthafuckin' dream in ya face
You keep lookin' for some women to be all in ya face
That deep dussy reach niggas, keep dussy
That Tennessee dussy make a nigga be dussy
You can never rap better than me, 'cause you ain't dedicated
You ain't underrated, you ain't under looked
You ain't overbooked, you just under cooked
It's supposed to be me and my niggas in the [record](undefined) [book](undefined)
Now they got by myself still fresh as fuck 
Man, Beyonce, I'm mad at you, man
[Chorus 1]
They say hello (hey), hello (hey)
I can daydream about Beyonce all day
Thinking bout the good times 'fore she met Jay
See ya know, they say hello (hey), hello (hey)
I really thought I had a chance to be your man
till I seen the video with the ring on your hand
It hurt me so
I remember you were sixteen on the TV screen with Wyclef
Were you my type? Oh God yes, I was impressed
You was like 'No, no, no', I was like twelve years old
Hoping that one day I could chaperone while you're on the road
You wore braids with a banging body
Looked like you did Pilates, a lot of sit-ups probably
But bump that, I was there from the start
Even when LeToya Luckett and that other doo-doo bucket broke your heart
Hope you didn't cry, cause honestly they were just so-so
They couldn't sing anyway, you deserved to go solo
No disrespect to Kelly and Michelle, I'm just saying
They cool, but you? You something like Wonder Woman
And I just want to hold your hand, bring you to Compton
Gonzales Park, we can build castles in the sand
Eating Hot Cheetos with pickle juice in it
Put that napkin down, you know I'll lick your fingers when you're finished
[Chorus 1]
I just bought the Sasha Fierce CD
I gazed at the cover for a whole five minutes till my girlfriend hit me
She's jealous of you B cause I don't love her like I love you
I even make her do the "uh-oh, uh-oh, oh-no-no" just like you do
She tell me I'm obsessed, I tell her we connect
like Ice Cube way before the Mack 10 feud
She like, you goddamn fool, that girl's rich and you're broke
I said, so, I'm five-hundred mill' away, there's still hope
Anyway, I had feelings way before you got paid
And I didn't laugh when you bust your ass on the stage
And I salute Kanye for taking up for you
I would have stole the award just to prove that I love you
But Jay shoulda did that, I thought he had your bizzack
What happened Mr. Izzo? Hopico with Frederico?
He used to be my favorite till he abandoned my diva
Now I tell everybody Nas had killed him on 'Ether'
[Chorus 2]
They say hello (hey), hello (hey)
I can daydream about Beyonce all day
Thinking bout the good times 'fore she met Jay
See ya know, they say hello (hey), hello (hey)
Hopefully I still have a chance
Maybe if I sabotage your man
You never know, hmm
I'ma sneak backstage at a Mary J. Blige concert
with an 'I Love Mary' shirt, then find Jay-Z
and push him into a dancer, hopefully they lock lips
That's when I yell out, Sounwave, hurry up, take the pic
Put it on Bossip the same night, yeah, that sound quite right
Publicity like that? Yep, they'd be sure to fight
Better yet I'ma steal his cell, then call up Affion
He impersonates Jay well, get Beyonce on the line
Then make up some bogus shit
Like you don't the back of my knees right, so this marriage is over with
And the ring that's on my finger, guess what, I'm throwing it (cling)
You heard the sound, so you know I did
Ha-hahhh, that should get him
I should break 'em up like a Kit Kat when I do that, yeah true that
I'ma put the plot in motion, that's for sure
But if I end up with Macy Gray, this plan never worked
Yeeeea, man I hope Jay don't be mad at me bout this song
Start-, ay Wizzle start me back from like the first verse
Like right before I come in
Haha, what you say? Nah, you think it'll be hot for real though?
Nigga, you stupid, they probably laughing as hard as you
Nig' got the best wife in the world and shit
Run that back though? 
 
[Intro]
Uh, I see everybody wanna play gansta now, huh
Well you know what n*ggas
I'mma just play Kendrick
You gotta respect it
Feel this
Uh, lemme sh*t on these n*ggas man[Verse 1]
Look homie I'm not your crip or your blood
Homie I'm just Kendrick
See me other than him might plead the fifth amendment
Hard headed n*gga sh*t all it take is an instant
Shocked to have scored just as soft as an infant
Say you bust your gun, but never totin' it
You say your man is dope I think he's sm*king it homie
Why you provoking it don't mean to boast a bit
But you can call me a fly cause your boy be on some sh*t
P*ssy fly so all the girlies think I'm the sh*t
I've got to spend but still never buy them sh*t
You better budge your b*tch
'Cause all it takes is a finger to turn her on holmes
Something like a lightswitch
Hands down but still dark think I might switch the Jag for the Porsche
'Cause it got a better steering grip
Young but been a man and you won't understand
Spree wheels looking like a bed room ceiling fan[Hook]
When the beef start cooking
And the sh*ts start coming
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
People start looking
And people start running
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
Rolling down Rosecrans
I fear no man
I be God damned
If I live on my knees I rather die on my feet
That hub city threat sh*t is me[Verse 2]
(N*gga) I'm from the land where fiends fly like Peter Pan
And the average man got a heat up in his d*ckie pants
I got some plans, to stack riches
Own 76â²s like a Philadelphian
You don't know but now I'm focused like camera lens
And if I know your mans I might give a second chance
'Cause I don't wanna hurt you
Have 'em running in herzels
Shells stick to his back like a ninja turtle
Cr*ck sells, drug sell all in the virtue
Been an artist since Prince played in Color Purple
Weed sm*ke hydro bl*w on that purple
2 straps on my side like suspenders on Urkel
I suspend they murk you, what you lying for?
You know you ain't eating like feed the children commercials
Man my children circle around your block
Let out sh*ts and be home 30 minutes before they curfew 
I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibeLook inside my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find doubt, it never exists
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hanging with ya
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Buried on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridgeI can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check, with all disrespect let me say thisI am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibeI'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past ya
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain, stuck in a box
Ima break out and then hide every lock
Ima break out and then hide every lockI can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check, with all disrespect let me say thisI am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibeYou ain't heard a chorus like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
3's in the air I can see you are - in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My new year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe 
[Hook]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe![Verse 1]
Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge[Bridge]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this[Hook]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe![Verse 2]

You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
