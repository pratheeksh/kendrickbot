Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They dont wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of 5 G5's with 5 grand
With your granddad as the pilot he drunk as fuck tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and popping prosthetic leg
Bumpin Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread 
Greeting boys and girls
My name is Petey P
Kendrick's childhood imaginary friend (that's right)
I am your neighbor
And I'd like to welcome you to good kid, m.A.A.d city
So grab your cartoons and cereal
Your pop guns and fireworks
And sing along)When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane(Kendrick, you remember that one time when we was)
I've been waiting on this day since Dr. Dre and Pac
Was on Rosecrans in that burgerstand at '95
People staring at 'em in amazement
Reservations at the Days Inn
We was living out a hotel at the time
Breakfast, lunch and dinner chicken from Kentucky Fried
Mama babysitting Section 8 vouchers the move
When nothing else to lose but a burger flipping job
Close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine it's a mansion
Gold ballroom, AK-47 dancing
Howling at the moon, what's a pack of hungry babies?
Hope you feed us soon, bite your back, you die of rabies
Everyday we pray to eat at the table at Sizzlers
But never make the visit, if better days was on its way
Then they make the decision, to make the wrong turn
So for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burn
(Oh I remember that, it was the ravioli with the hot sauce in it, right?)When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like ColtraneAnd all the ghetto children in the world say, "that's my car"
All the ghetto boys say, "that's my car"
All the ghetto girls say, "that's my car"
When we grow up, when we grow up
Ghetto children in the world say, "that's my car"
All the ghetto boys say, "that's my car"
All the ghetto girls say, "that's my car"
When we grow up, when we grow up(Nigga you remember the smoke and the burning buildings and shit?)
Couple stolen T.V.'s and a seat belt for my safety
Played the passenger I think it's five years after eighty
Seven, do the math, '92 don't you be lazy
Looking out the window, notice all the essentials
Of a block party that stop for a second, then it rekindle
Like a flame from a trick candle, everybody got dental
Insurance 'cause we 'bout to floss, you get that couch I sent you?
I heard that from a block away, probably had credentials
Of a scholar but shit not today, them Dayton Spokes was his to take
Refrigerators, barbecue pits, and Jordan kicks
They did invasions while helicopters recorded it
Hello Mi-Mister Miyagi, I want them Kenwood woofers
Say that you got me if not, I'll dig in your drawer for it
The swap meet was the bulls' eye like Tauruses
Murder was the melody you should know what the chorus is
"Papa you really telling me we can just get some more of it
If we run out?" He said, "lil nigga today the poor is rich
Don't tell your mom that you seen a Molotov bomb
If she ask just know you have to lie and son don't forget
Bitches ain't shit, hoes ain't neither
Niggas gon snitch, watch the company you keeping
And one day you'll put money in the ghetto when you got it
Rather than having to hustle off these Rodney King riots"
(That's right the mothafuckin' Rodney King
You was with your daddy on Bullis Road)When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane 
 
Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar
I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God
They say he the key to my blessings, and if I speak the good
Into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock
Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock
And by the way I'mma start, finding more light to shed
Like a small garage in your backyard
I'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine
But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
Always hollering who she don't like and who she kick it with
Who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave
Who Dooney and Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys
To the car she drove last year or who fucking on who
And who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves
But before your negative energy curve, bitch I'mma cut you off'Cause everytime you come around, you be hollering that
Whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah, he say, she say
Oh my God, shut the fuck up... ho
Everytime you come around, you be hollering that
Whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah, he say, she sayUhh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
Or at least inquire similar desires
To do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P
I'm talking ideas, motivation
It's more than making, enemies, my nigga
Oh, that's not your memo? Then tell me why you constantly stressing
On how you well connected like centipedes, my nigga
I function with you and you flaunt your pistol
Every second tell me how you pressed 'em at the Monte Cristo
Where so and so from, and what neighborhoods beefing
Who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend
That shit is mad depressing, bringing me down
Speak on something with some substance that can get us both paid
Rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style
Or his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, I'mma cut you off'Cause everytime you come around, you be hollering that
Whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah, he say, she say
Oh my God, shut the fuck up... scary ass
Everytime you come around, you be hollering that
Whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah, he say, she sayUh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star
I'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa
Studying art... now paint that picture
Life behind bars, remember the very day I got caught?
I murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?
See what I was taught, family is all I need
But indeed them too can run me right up a tree
Constantly talking shit 'bout the next relative
Wanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in
Ever since grandma died, everyone parted ways
Argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison
For 15 years, no one paid him attention but moms
Yeah, my momma as loyal as any sister would come
Come to my house just to yap about your own people
Dang, and if your blood wasn't running through my veins
I would prolly cut y'all off too, yep'Cause everytime you come around, y'all be hollering that
Whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah, he say, she say
Oh my God, shut the fuck up... (Keep it running Ali)
Everytime you come around, you be hollering that
Whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah, he say, she saySo tell 'em, "Shut the fuck up!" Tell 'em, "Shut the fuck up!"
Yeah, bitch, you boo-boo, you T'd, you turnt down, you thirstyTell 'em, "Shut the fuck up!" Tell 'em, "Shut the fuck up!"

I got, I got, I got, I got
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition, flow, inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this
Immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this
Was Yeshua's new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got
Realness, I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome, heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you
This is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids
And I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier's DNA
Born inside the beast
My expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to
Antisocial, extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And that's a riff, gonna plead this case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet sayI got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
(This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage
To young African Americans than racism in recent years)
I live a better, fuck your life
(5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the makin' of marriagesTell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you're in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows, I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murderâthese are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murderâour DNA

I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibeLook inside my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find doubt, it never exists
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hanging with ya
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Buried on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridgeI can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check, with all disrespect let me say thisI am a sinner

You trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past ya
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame

I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal

It was always me versus the world
Until I found it's me versus me
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Just remember what happens on earth stays on earth!
We gon' put it in reverseDarling I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you sweetheart that myâOh Lamar, Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny mothafucka
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts
Children listen, it gets deep
See once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable, gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and joking made life easier
Hard times, momma on crack
A four-year-old telling his nanny he needed her
His family history pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous
Clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman workin' for his big homie
Small time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
Ten thousand dollars out of a project housing
That's on the daily, seen his first mil twenty years old
Had a couple of babies, had a couple of shooters
Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun
They assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back
And they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang
That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came
Circlin' parkin' lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrasing the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed them off and walked back
To the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See at this chicken spot
There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth
He worked the window, his name was Ducky
He came from the streets the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars
They had a son hoping that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine to five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects
Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before back in '84
That's when affiliation was really eight gears of war
So many relatives telling us, selling us devilish works
Killing us crime, intelligent, felonious
Prevalent proposition with nines
Ducky was well aware, they robbed the manager
And shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line
Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him and then let him slide
They didn't kill him, in fact it look like
They're the last to survive
Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives
One curse at a time, reverse the manifest
And good karma and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers
And put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul so they can
Make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later them same strangers
You make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reaping their benefits
Then you start reminding them 'bout that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper
Would be from coincidence
Because if Anthony killed Ducky
Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfightSo I was taking a walk the other day 
It was always me versus the world
Until I found it's me versus me
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Just remember what happens on earth stays on earth!
We gon' put it in reverseDarling I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you sweetheart that myâOh Lamar, Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny mothafucka
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts
Children listen, it gets deep
See once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable, gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and joking made life easier
Hard times, momma on crack
A four-year-old telling his nanny he needed her
His family history pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous
Clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman workin' for his big homie
Small time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
Ten thousand dollars out of a project housing
That's on the daily, seen his first mil twenty years old
Had a couple of babies, had a couple of shooters
Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun
They assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back
And they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang
That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came
Circlin' parkin' lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrasing the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed them off and walked back
To the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See at this chicken spot
There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth
He worked the window, his name was Ducky
He came from the streets the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars
They had a son hoping that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine to five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
To witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I start questioning God, "What is my purpose?"
He said to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian
And this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit, my life is so fucked up, man; I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
Then lost my faith again[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
(don't you give up dont you give in...
Faith, all you need is the size of a mustard seed[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Single black parent from Compton raising children of 4
That's 4 innocent bastards cause Papa, they don't know
Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
Can't find no one to watch her kids, so she pay her sister
Her baby daddy ain't 'bout shit, that nigga ain't 'bout shit
Spilt his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
She pray to God every night hoping that he'll mature
And maybe one day his kids, something that he'll live for
Baby wanna go back to school but she need some help
Because it's hard trying to pay the bills when you're by yourself
She thought about credit card scams, 'til she heard a voice
That said, "The Devil is a lie, make a better choice."
And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing
With those crazy ass people at the county building
Looked to the heavens and asked Him to make a better way
Then got a letter in the mail, lost her Section 8
Then lost her faith again[Hook][Verse 3: Punch]
I had dreams of holding a 9 milla to Ray's killa
Ask him why as my eyes fill up
Each day it gets more realer, orangutan's bang like gorillas
It's jungle when the niggas in zoo
The rats lurking, the vulture's circling the serpents
Cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it
I flirted with the ideal of caressing the steel
To make karma come faster than she normally will
It's ill, to see my faith try and leave me
It's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy
I'm tryna reach Cloud 9, that's what my niggas 'bout
But it never rain in California unless the pistols out
Until then, my feet planted on the ground
Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
And if I get no answer, just know I tried
I should have never looked into his son's eyes
Rayshawn Boyce[Hook][Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
Your mind's slipping, wondering, "Is there really a God?"
Knowing you shouldn't think that way and trying to freeze your brain
But whenever there's pain, that feeling forever remains
We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
Cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
At the tender age of 12, and you feel that no one cares
Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
Just know when you feeling that way spirit's in the room
I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
And wonder why I ain't ever caught that feeling before
Maybe they know Him better, or I don't know no better
But what I do know, is that He's real and He lives forever
So the next time you feel like your world's about to end
I hope you studied because He's testing your faith again[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I'd rather not live like there isn't a God
Than die and find out there really is
Think about it 
(I don't think I can find a way to make it on this earth)
What's up family, yeah it's yo cousin Carl man, just given' you a call man
I know you been havin' a lot on yo mind lately
And I know you feel like ya know people ain't been prayin' for you
But you have to understand this man, that we are a cursed people
Deuteronomy 28:28 says
"The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness
And astonishment of heart."
See family that's why you feel like
You feel like you got a chip on your shoulder
Until you finally get the memo, you will always feel that wayWhy God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, why don't you burn this mufucka?(I don't think I can find a way to make it on this earth)I beat yo' ass, keep talkin' back
I beat yo' ass, who bought you that?
You stole it, I beat yo' ass if you say that game is broken
I beat yo' ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo' ass if you walk in this house with tears in your eyes
Runnin' from poopoo and 'prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Yo' teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up, I beat yo' ass
You better not run to your father, I beat yo' ass
You know my patience runnin' thin
I got beaucoup payments to make
County building's on my ass
Tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one elseIf I can smoke fear away, I roll that motherfucker up
And then I take two puffs
I'm high now, I'm high now
I'm high now, I'm high now
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now(I don't think I can find a way to make it on this earth)
I'll prolly die anonymous
I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die 'cause these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me false accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers
Are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna diffuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled thingsIf I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up
And then I'd take two puffs
I've been hungry all my life
I'm high now, I'm high now
I'm high now, I'm high now
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now, nowWhen I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor somebody that's holdin' my checks?
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out
And just kill somethin', drill somethin'
Get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal
If my reputation would miss me
What they see from me
Would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me
Would make 'em highlight my simplest linesI'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings
With me so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on earth stays on earth
And I can't take these feelings with me
So hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rapDamn
Goddamn you
Goddamn me
Goddamn us
Goddamn we
Goddamn us allVerse two says you only have I known of all the families of the earth
Therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We're gonna be in this place, we're gonna be under this curse
Because he said he's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites according to the Bible
The children of Israel, he's gonna punish us for our iniquities
For our disobedience because we chose to follow other gods
That aren't his son, so the Lord thy God chasten you
So just like you'll chasten your own son
He's gonna chasten you because he loves you
So that's why we get chastised, that's why we're in the position we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments
And do what the Lord said, these curses are gonna be upon us
We're gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live here in today
In the United States of America
I love you, son, and I pray for you
God bless you, shalom

Goddamn us allVerse two says you only have I known of all the families of the earth
Therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We're gonna be in this place, we're gonna be under this curse
Because he said he's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites according to the Bible
The children of Israel, he's gonna punish us for our iniquities
For our disobedience because we chose to follow other gods
That aren't his son, so the Lord thy God chasten you
So just like you'll chasten your own son
He's gonna chasten you because he loves you
So that's why we get chastised, that's why we're in the position we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments
And do what the Lord said, these curses are gonna be upon us
We're gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live here in today
In the United States of America
I love you, son, and I pray for you
God bless you, shalom 
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for meAin't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for meI feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin'
I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my daughter compromised and jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
I feel for you, I've been in the field for you
It's real for you, right? Shit, I feel likeAin't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin'I feel niggas been out of pocket
I feel niggas tappin' they pockets
I feel like debated on who the greatest can stop it
I am legend, I feel like all of y'all is peasants
I feel like all of y'all is desperate
I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music, though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' what 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks, and bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts our logic
I feel like say somethin', I feel like take somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Who prayin' for me?

Mercedes Benz and twenty four inch rims, five percent tint, and air conditioning vents
Hell fuckin' naw, this dick ain't free

Not a forty ounce and a pitbull
Bullshit, matador, matador, had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious, kept me up watchin'
Pornos and poverty, apology? No
Watch you volunteer it it while people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has it's day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter fact it need interest, matter fact it's nine inches
Matter fact see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin', my consensus
Been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
Fuck you think is bullshit, porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
Choice is deaf, a state of decapitated the horseman
Oh America, you bad bitch, I the picked cotton that made you rich
Now my dick ain't freeI'mma get my Uncle Sam to fuck you up
You ain't no king 
Fuck you, motherfucker, you a ho-ass nigga

Whats wrong nigga?
I thought you was keeping it gangsta?
I thought this what you wanted?
They say if you scared go to church
But remember
He knows the bible tooMy baby when I get you get you get you get you
I'ma go head to ride with you
Smoking lokin' poking the deja till I'm idle with you
Cause I (want you)
Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving
Cause I (want you)
I want you more than you knowI remember you took me to the mall last week baby
You looked me in my eyes about 4 5 times
Till I was hypnotized then you clarified
That I (want you)
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy
I said you crazy
Roses are red violets are blue but me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you)My baby when I get you get you get you get you
I'ma go head to ride with you
Smoking lokin' poking the deja till I'm idle with you
Cause I (want you)You said to me
You said your name was Lucy
I said where's Ricardo?
You said oh no, not the show
Than you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned 26 I was like oh shit
You said to me
I remember what you said too, you said
"My name is Lucy, Kendrick
You introduced me Kendrick
Usually I don't do this
But I see you and me Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries
Lucy got million stories
About these rappers I came after when they was boring
Lucy gone fill your pockets
Lucy gone move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty
Avoiding me?
It's not so easy I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute
Lucy work harder
Lucy gone call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy
I loosely heard prayers on your first album truly
Lucy don't mind cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paper work on top of paper work
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up then sign this contract if that's possible"Get you get you get you get you
I'ma go head to ride with you
Smoking lokin' poking the doja till I'm idle with you
Cause I (want you)
Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving
Cause I (want you)I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Until I came home

[Intro]
And this is for the homies
I'm talking bout the swap meets, Rollie
Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we...[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Somebody get ready to pass me the hit of that endo, I'm tryna get blown
I'm tryna get turned up like the fifteens in my Cadillac brown
Looking for E.T. to phone home
Tadow, the flavor I kick reminisce the good days
Thinking back when we used to run in the swap meet for the Rollie chains
Pro Club t-shirts, whiter than Anglo-Saxons
Make it a 1X-Tall, crispy with the cotton fashion
That's fashion if you come where I'm from
Compton California, One love to the murder capital under the sun
Young niggas running around the street with heat bigger than me
But I don't trip, I still dip like salsa to a chip
Rolling down Rosecrans to scoop up my man, A-Mack
He talking about some foolishness on how we can pick up on some hoes, believe that
And so I scooped him round 3:30, Telling me it's all good
Tiger Woods, Now we looking for the birdy birdies
Stopped at the sto' to get some rubbers
Pulled up on the breezies, Well what do you know? I think they love us[Hook]
And this is for the homies
I'm talking bout the swap meets, Rollie
Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we got it going on
And if you feel good (hey)
Raise your hands high and throw up your hood (hey)
Represent the city like you know you should (hey)
I want to make sure that you understood we got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on[Verse 2]
As I continue my day, quite copacetic
Headed to my momma's house to see what them greens are talking bout, hungry as hell
Had the right grub, I bail, need some gas
ARCO station on Avalon, a relative hit me up as he rolled past
We used to stand in line for Jordans, excited we got 'em
Rocking platinum FUBU jeans with rubber bands tied to the bottom
Throwback jerseys, Chamberlain and James Worthy was two of my favorites
I might pull out the green Larry Bird on special occasions
But anyway I'm steady coasting, smoking on that Hiroshima
Ashtray got a million roaches, I'm focussed but feeling good
The homies hanging on the sixties and Monte Carlos
Impalas and Tahoes, shoot something nigga, break that fifty
I'm grabbing the city like I'm supposed to
Making my presence felt like Christmas day, what can I say?
Every vocal is spoken with the wisdom of a G
If you can't relate then please have a seat[Hook][Verse 3]
So, wherever you located, won't you let it be known
And put on for the soil of which you was grown
I put on like brand new Chuck Taylors
While giving you cuts like fresh tapers
I'm such a fool with it, go nuts
You bullshitting like Tuck, the bounce then untuck
The bounce then throw up, a rare jewel, you duck
Take 'em to school I must, this for the cool in us
This ain't for you, so what?! 
 
You said you'd never ever break, down
But here I am sweeping, pieces off of the ground
You said you'd never, ever play, to crowds
But I've seen you hoping to play songs to them now
I've spent all night long scared of tomorrow, broke my alarm
Everything's almost lost, pick it up slow, before it's goneWe're fragile
(Wish I'd have known)
I never thought I'd be so fragile
(You're not alone)
If it didn't break before it's about to
(We've been here before)
I don't ever want to change
I'm fragile
I don't everSome of the people appointed to give an opinion
Never do get it
I want you to come on and gobble a jimmy and... die
N9na be giving the remedy and why?
Critics are really the enemy and I
Can't stand the way they slam today's gifted
Effin' incredible, get fanned away with grands to pay
This jam will lay scripted
Deaf and impeccable
Write a rhyme and I put everything in a flow
I'm the N9ne I'm a look very mean
When a foe scribe a line but he has never been at a show
By the times it'll be better, leave it in the sto'
'Cause they wrote nothin' but lies, quotes stuck in my eyes
Amateur writer dissin'
He's a beginner and hopes for your demise, folks some may despise
Never do try to listen
It's real, I'm mad
Clueless when you scribble on your pad
How you gonna criticize with a chisel on your nads sizzling your ad
You don't really get why I'm so pissed? Understand this (Understand this)
I'm an artist, and I'm sensitive about my shit, yes I'mWe're fragile
(Wish I'd have known)
I never thought I'd be so fragile
(You're not alone)
If it didn't break before it's about to
(We've been here before)
I don't ever want to change
I'm fragile
I don't everTell me that I'm famous
Tell me that my name is
Big as Venus Jupiter and then Uranus
Tell me that your anus got your head in it
I can smell the articles and know you're heinous
Tell me that you love me, always thinkin' of me
Unconditional, I'm hoping I'm your favourite
Grab a fishing pole and throw me with the sharks
That's the feelin' I get when you're concentratin'
On this pen, on this pad
Tell me you're willin' to diss on my craft
Tell me the feelin' of pickin' apart this track
Stop
Puttin' my heart and my soul in these lines
Tellin' me platinum and gold all the time
Lookin' to bury, a deep hole for mine
Drop
This is more than you, and this is more than you
And your entire building slanderin' and abusin'
What I call the realest comin' from a student
Told myself to use a poem as an UZI
Empty magazine, I seen a magazine
You seen my trigger finger, then I started shootin'
That was nicotine, I'm 'bout to smoke 'em all
And journalists involved should've known my musicWe're fragile
(Wish I'd have known)
I never thought I'd be so fragile
(You're not alone)
If it didn't break before it's about to
(We've been here before)
I don't ever want to change
I'm fragile
I don't ever 
Gather round, I'm glad everybody came out tonight
As we stand on our neighborhood corner
Know that this fire that's burning represents the passion you have
Listen, Keisha, Tammy, come up front
I recognize all of you, every creed and color
With that being said, fuck your ethnicity, you understand that?
We gon' talk about a lot of shit that concerns you, all of youNow everybody throw your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck throw your hands up high
Throw your hands up highNow I don't give a fuck if you
Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, goddamn it
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity niggaFire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life
Y'all be calling it hip hop, I be calling it hypnotize
Yeah, hypnotize, trapped my body but freed my mind
What the fuck are you fighting for? Ain't nobody gon' win that war
My details be retail, man I got so much in store
Racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines
Fuck that, nigga look at that line, it's so diverse
They getting off work and that wanna see Kendrick
Everybody can't drive Benzs, and I been there, so I make it my business
To give 'em my full attention, ten-hut, man I gotta get my wind up
Man I gotta get down with God cause I got my sins up, ooh
Matter of fact, don't mistake me for no fucking rapper
They sit backstage and hide behind the fucking camerasI mosh pit, had a microphone, I tossed it
Had a brain, then I lost it, I'm out of my mind
So don't you mind how much the cost it, penny for my thoughts
Everybody please hold up your wallets
Yeah man, I'm the mailman, can't you tell man?
Going postal, never freeze up when I approach you
That's star-struck, and roast you, oh my, HiiiPoWeRNow I don't give a fuck if you
Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, goddamn it
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity niggaI'm tired of y'all, cause everybody lied to y'all
Do you believe it? Recognize them false achievements
It's treason and I'm Tylenol, I knock out when you knock it off
Knock of the doors of opportunity, I'm too involved
I'm no activist, I'm no Einstein, before calculus I was kicking in math
Dropping that science like an alchemist, and I be kicking that ass
Lyrically I'm UFC
If a UFO had came for me I'ma come back with the head of alien
Don't alienate my dreams, get it right, get a life
I got two, that's a metaphor for the big shit I do
Boy, TMI, TSA, man I'm fly
Put wings on my back, that a plane or angel? Both
Like a pilot with a halo, whoa, grossI don't mean nothing, so many things come through
Them, him, her, you, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
I'm just a messenger
Yeah I know life's a bitch, get the best of herPut them threes up, they notice that we up
HiiiPoWeR, and the power, and the people
And if they don't believe us, they'll die
WizardNow I don't give a fuck if you
Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, goddamn it
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity nigga

I kill 'em with kindness
Or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get your ass killed by the finest
Everything life is a gamble
Nothing in life I can't handle
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more
For the cars, I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all
Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angelI don't rush shit, fuck shit, always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit
Morning to the night shift, I'm on
I ain't sorry for it, ask for a piece of mine
You charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit, levitate, ducking haters
Oh my, my heart is rich, my heart is famousThis what God feel like, yeah (this what God feel like)

Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station babyLook inside these walls and you see them having withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire
To fire bullets that stray
Track a tire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir what do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith
As the record spin I should pray
For the record I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity building
It's probably big as a building
Me jumping off of the roof
Is just me playing it safe
But what am I supposed to do
When the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't
But know I'm accustomed to
Just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walking from bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place
They was wondering if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind because one day you'll respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. cityMass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station babyAll I see is strobe lights
Blinding me in my hindsight
Finding me by myself
Promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference
And grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning
I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignoring my purpose
To persevere as a better person
I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I supposed to do
With the blinking of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof
And your dog has to say roof
And you ask, "Lift up your shirt"
Cause you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard them chatter: "He's probably young but I know that he's down"
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet proof vest
He don't mind, he know he'll never respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. cityMass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations
This is your station babyAll I see in this room
20 Xanies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain
Can we live in the same society
It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim
I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm
Inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room
With 20 Xanies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy I lost it
I feel it's nothing to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind, 'cause now you ever in debt
To good kid, m.A.A.d. cityMass hallucination baby
Ill education baby

(Intro)
Yeah, Kendrick Lamar. This is for the town nigga!(Verse 1)
Me I'm from the hub city Yeah that compton court building
Caught a murder when his homie died Judge Caught Feelings
Im on Rosecrans chilling right inside best outlest
Five dollar Little Caesar Momma shopped at Food for less
Elementary McNair say whats up to Vanguard
Centennial high, had me swimming with a pool of sharks
Me I'm just a good kid trying to keep it neutral
But Im well aware that a square can get shot too
Most Crip and some Piru thats just how the game go
Hood on every corner stop for gas and get your brains blown
Bitches with fat asses burning in the stashes
Murders in July call that summer time madness
Rest in peace 4bent rest in peace moss-berg
Swear to god when I make it big yo voice will be heard
Me Im just a good kid trying to keep it positive
Though I know its chaos forever my heart will live in...(Chorus)
Compton, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in Compton
These streets will make you or break you
Expire or inspire you
Let's hear it for Compton, Compton, Compton(Verse 2)
Take you back to Y.E.T it was just divining me
Earl had got disciplined for not catching a fade that week
Shit had made him stronger though, yeah those were the good old days
Eating Tam's burger while my Juvenile CD had played
21 outside maybe sideline pop
Yellow tape on sidewalk damn somebody got popped
Hoping that I live a lot, I don't want to die young
Please don't come shoot up my party, I just want to have fun
Sheriffs in my rear view, mother fuck the police
Pull me over just to plant an 8 ball on me
Fuck it though I'm out here, I've always been out here
Since the Compton swap meet, black and red LA gears
Pac was on Rosecrans nigga I was right there
Cali Love video he said whattup I said yeah
Free my nigga J-Dub and both of the J-Mans
Eazy paved the way, Lil Eazy bout to get it in for..(Chorus)(Verse 3)
I'm talking bout Westside Piru, N.H.P., Campanella, Carver Park
Front Hood, Nutty Blocc, Lantana, 151, Park Village
Cedar Block, Santana
Burgundy and Blue bandanas
Peace! Peace!
Fruit Town, Kelly Park, Southside, Elm Street
Poccet Hood, ATF, MOB, LPP, 135, VTP
Atlantic Drive, Limehood, NHC, PBC
Peace! Peace!
Tragniew, Compton Raymonds, Tree-Top, Mona Park, T Flats, 7 Os, 155
Compton Swamps, Holly hood, T Zones
All a nigga really want for us to keep
Peace! Peace!
But shit that a take some time and more time
But I'm pushing to get us there in no time
Me, I'm just a good kid hoping I can spread love
Word to the county building forever I do it for...(Chorus)(Outro)
[My nigga Hootie told me to keep it Compton, keep it Compton yeah
E-S-T 1987, Dominguez Hospital that bitch was on Bullis Road] 
Love's gonna get you killed
But pride's gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me andIt wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I careHell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldy possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart
You love 'em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in the perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics hoping I make amend
I understand I ain't perfect
I probably won't come around
This time, I might put you down
Last time, I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I'm willing to give up a leg and arm and show empathy from
Pity parties and functions and you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecureIt wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I careMaybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't thereNow, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December, but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point, nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, worldIt wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I careMaybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there

Fake my death, go to Cuba, that's the only optionIf I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy

Goddamn us all if you won't
Damn, damn, damn, it's a goddamn shame
You ain't frontline, get out the goddamn wayNiggas thought they wasn't gonna see me, huh?
Niggas thought that K-Dot real life
Was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real
Most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference between black artists and wack artistsIf I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
(It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri)
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element 
I got, I got, I got, I got
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition, flow, inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this
Immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this
Was Yeshua's new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got
Realness, I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome, heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you
This is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids
And I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier's DNA
Born inside the beast
My expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to
Antisocial, extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And that's a riff, gonna plead this case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet sayI got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
(This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage
To young African Americans than racism in recent years)
I live a better, fuck your life
(5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the makin' of marriagesTell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you're in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows, I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murderâthese are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murderâour DNA

Kendrick Lamar is always right on time
Oh, you thought you had me all figured out?
Take it from the horses mouth, you'll never understand me
I told you the plan B was to win your hearts before we win a Grammy
These days ain't shit changed, different toilet - same shit
And I drunk a whole gallon of laxatives by accident just to shit on you has beens
Had it been for my past tense I wouldn't be rappin'
But now I'm here
GQ, man of the year 
Where are we going, why are we slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing now
Smoke to it nigga, smoke to it nigga
Where are we going, we should be slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing nowThat's what she said to me
That place I used to call home is just a bed to me
We don't even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep
Meanwhile I'm in these streets with everybody, I'm trying to get it
And she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch me
As they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
Look each other in the face and barely blink
Tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink
So if my letters don't reach you, I hope these lyrics in syncWhere are we going, why are we slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing nowThat's what it said to me but the place I call ambition now dead to me
Gone and forgotten, I'm off track like Dale Earnhardt, my liver rotten
Alcoholic tripping, fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
Club night, guys and dolls, balling out but I'm about to drop the ball
I'm calling out for help, my engineer called
Told me come to the studio but I wanna tell him nahWhere are we going, why are we slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing nowThat's what he said to but that place we call Heaven is unfair to me
Only 144 can go, seven billion people on planet Earth today
Is there something that I don't know
I know to follow Him rather than follow people or follow vanity
'Cause that means I'm following evil, guess I'm following evil
I should follow cathedral, blessings I need but live like I don't need youWhere are we going, why are we slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing nowSo in conclusion, we all seem to stumble, planning our own demise
Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
So to what is important in my life, I apologize
I promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
We all get distracted
The question is would you bounce back or bounce backwards?
Would you not know how to act or take action? It's just a part of life
And if your vision's impaired, you probably lose it all tonightTrying to visualize how to get it right but my vision's so blurry
Trying to slow it down, stay close to the ground but we're always in a hurry
And if I could make this world spin a little slower then I would
Then we could grow a little closer, I think we're getting closer
I think we're getting closer... 
My nigga, what it look like?Niggas hatin', bitches hatin', babies dyin'
Bullets flyin', helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying
Genocism, criticism, unemployment, racism
Burning buildings, AIDS victims, cancer killin' no cure
Oil spillin', turmoil, poverty stricken, police brutality
Kickin' ass of us Africans, hostages in Afghanistan
Not to mention another prison, child molesting
Cow intestines, botox injections, earthquakes that's government tested
Secret society weapon, opium plant manifested
Then turn to crack then invested amongst us Blacks just a message
To hold us back, great depression amongst Iraq, no direction no Google map
Just a Tec for the soo-woop swerving, izuzu then blap blap blap
Adolescents go coocoo, mothers are boohoo crying
The governor keeps us starvin', these commercials keep us buyin'
These cigarettes supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph
Distincted livin' with science, no place to live in, no Zion
See that's forbidden, we fryin'My nigga, what it look like?
(That's exactly what hell look like)Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is homeboy
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is, tell them what's up!Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is homeboy
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is, tell them what's up!My nigga, what it look like?Malcolm laughing, Martin laughing, Biggie spittin'
Pac is rapping, Gregory tappin, people singing, bells is ringing
Children playing, angels praying, 14 karat golden streets, collard greens
Red wine, potato yams, turkey legs, calling every human being 
 
[Verse 1]
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song
The Serengeti's cloned
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your diisc when I slipped you my disc
You wanted to diss but jumped on my dick
Grown man should never bite they tongue
Unless you eating p-ssy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the muthaf-cking pistol
Aiming it at a pig, Charlottes Web is gonna miss you
My issue wasn't televised and you aint gotta tell the wise
how to stay on beat cause our lives an instrumental
This is physical and mental
I wouln't sugar coat it
You'll die from Diabetes if these other n-ggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want no plastic nation
Read that like a Hatian
While you muthafckers waiting
I be off the slave ship, building pyramids writing my own hieroglyphs[Hook]
Just call this shit hi power
N-gga nothing less than hi power
5 star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean this shit is Huey Newton going stupid
You can't resist his Hi Power
Throw your hands up for Hi Power[Verse 2]
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If i seen it how he seen it that would make my parents happy
Sorry momma I can't turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a f-cking widows peak, ugh
She always told me pray for the weak, ugh
Them demons got me, I aint prayed in some weeks, ughDear Lord, come and save me, the Devils working hard
He probably clocking double shifts on all of his jobsFrightening, so f-cking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane
I need a license to kill
Im standing on a feild full of Landmines
Doing the moonwalk hoping I blow up in time
Cause 2012 might not be a f-cking legend
Try and be a f-cking legend
The man of mankind
Who said a black man in the illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs[Hook]
Just call this shit hi power
N-gga nothing less than hi power
5 star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean this shit is Bobby Seale making mills
You can't resist his Hi Power
Throw your hands up for Hi Power[Bridge]
Everyday we fight the system just to make our way
We've been down for too long, but thats all right
We was built to be strong, cause it's our life
na-na-nah
Everyday we fight the system, (fight the system)
(Never liked the system)
We've been down for too long, but thats all right
na-na-nahWho said a black man in the illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
Last time I checked we was racing with Marcus Garvey
On the freeway to Africa til I wrecked my hardy
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy my fate is inevitable
They played musical chairs, once I'm on that pedestal
Frightening, so f-cking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauren Hill don't sing or Kurt Cobain
loaded that clip and then said BANG!
The drama it bring is crazy
Product of the late 80?s
Tryna stay above water, thats why we shun the navy
Pull your guns and play me
Let's set it off, cause a riot, thow off molotov's
Somebody told me them pirates aint got lost
Cause we've been off slave ships
Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs[Hook]

[Intro]
Everybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
Section 80, Hiii Power[Verse 1]
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song
The Serengeti's clone, back to put you backstabbers
Back on your spinal bone, you slipped your disc
When I slid you my disc, you wanted to diss but jumped on my dick
Grown men, never should bite their tongue
Unless you eatin' pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the mothafuckin' pistol
Aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's web is going to miss you
My issue isn't televised and you ain't gotta tell the wise
How to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
This is physical and mental, I won't sugar coat it
You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian
While you mothafuckas waiting, I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs[Hook]
Just call the shit Hiii Power
Nigga nothing less than Hiii Power
Five-star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is, Huey Newton going stupid
You can't resist his Hiii Power
Throw your hands up for Hiii Power[Verse 2]
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy
Sorry mama, I can't turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widow's peak, uhh
And she always told me pray for the weak, uhh
Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uhh
Dear Lord come save me, the devil's working hard
He probly clockin' double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license to kill
I'm standing on the field full of land mines
Doing the moonwalk, hoping I blow up in time
Cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend
Trying to be a fucking legend, the man of mankind
Who said a black man in the Illuminati
Last time I check, that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs[Hook]
Just call the shit Hiii Power
Nigga nothing less than Hiii Power
Five-star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is, Bobby Seale making meals
You can't resist his Hiii Power
Throw your hands up for Hiii Power[Bridge: Alori Joh]
Every day we fight the system, just to make our way
We been down for too long but that's alright
We was built to be strong cause it's our life, na-na-na
Every day we fight the system, we fight the system
We fight the system (Never like the system)
We been down for too long but that's alright, na-na-na[Verse 3]
Who said a black man in the Illuminati
Last time I check, that was the biggest racist party
Last time I check, we was racing with Marcus Garvey
On the freeway to Africa 'til I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain
Loaded that clip and then said bang, the drama it bring is crazy
Product of the late 80s
Trying to stay above water, that's why we shun the navy
Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off
Cause a riot, throw a Molotov, somebody told me them pirates had got lost
Cause we been off them slave ships
Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs[Hook]
Just call the shit Hiii Power
Yeah nothing less than Hiii Power
Five-star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is, Fred Hampton on your campus
You can't resist his Hiii Power
Throw your hands up for Hiii Power[Outro]

I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimentin' me on my nappy hair
If I can f-ck her in front of all of these passengers
They'll prob'ly think I'm a terrorist
Eat my asparagus, then I'm askin' her
Thoughts of a young nigga, fast money and freedom
A crash dummy for diamonds, I know you dyin' to meet 'em
I'll prob'ly die in a minute
Just bury me with twenty bitches, twenty million, and a Comptown fittedHol' up (Hol' up) hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up) hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin'
Section 80Back in this bitch in the back of that bitch
Wit' my back against the wall and yo' bitch on the edge of my dick
Jump off
I call a bitch a bitch, a ho a ho, a woman a woman
I never did nothin' but break the ground on top of the asphalt
Tire mark gave you evidence that I'm easily peddlin' with the speed of a lightnin' bolt
As a kid I killed two adults, I'm too advanced
I live my twenties at two years old, the wiser man
Truth be told, I'm like eighty-seven
Wicked as eighty reverends in a pool of fire wit' devils holdin' hands
From the distance, don't know which one is a Christian, damn
Who can I trust in 2012? There's no one
Not even myself, a Gemini screamin' for help, somebodyHol' up (Hol' up) hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up) hol' up (Hol' up)

Hol' up (Hol' up) hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin' (Ay, ay, kick her out the studio, Ali)24/7 nigga, workin' his ass for it, she poppin' that ass for it
The King of Diamonds wit' diamonds I never do ask for
They checkin' my passport, I'm too accustomed with Customs
She call in the task force, I killed it, somebody cuff 'I'm
They want me to fast-forward the game, and why you complain
When you niggas is past poor, you'll never hop in my lane
When you pushin' a RAV4, you wreckin' my Jaguar
You play like a bad sport, her feet on the dashboardHol' up (Hol' up) hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up) hol' up (Hol' up)

Stewardess complimentin' me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
They'll prob'ly think I'm Osama
The plane emergency landed, it was an honor hol' up 
K dot, pick up the phone, nigga.
Every time I call, its going to voice mail.
Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga.
No socks and skinny jeans and shit. Call me on Shaniqua's phoneI been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homiesI don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga
Our lil homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
Fuck what they talkin' bout, your shit is where its at, my nigga
Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game your hood, your name in this game
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin' to the scripts, now hear if them benjamin's go cuddle up
Skip, hop, trip, drop, flip, flop with the white tube sock
It goes "Sherm Sticks, burn this"
Thats what the product smells like when the chemicals mix
50 nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with youI been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homiesHopped out the caddy, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called, they said, "The enemies done cliqued up"
Oh yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Niggas name on paper, you snitched all summer
The streets don't fail me now, they tell me it's a new gang in town
From Compton to Congress, it's set trippin' all around
Ain't nothin' new but a flow of new DemoCrips and ReBloodlicans
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin'?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
Make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom they fuck with you, Obama say, "What it do?"I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homiesEverybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin'
Motherfucker if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Y'all priorities are fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don't ask about no camera back at award shows
No, don't ask about my bitch, no, don't ask about my foes
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
"K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora's box"
I box 'em all in, by a landslide
Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay
He said "it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game"I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo booI remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
I didn't want to self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivors guilt
Going back and forth
Trying to convince my self the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting
A continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one 
Frustration (watching you dance)
Hesitation (to get in them pants)
Come closer baby (so I can touch)
One question, am I moving too fast?Cause' I ain't leaving alone feel like I could be honest babe
We both know that we're grown
That's why I wanna knowHow many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three
You look good, we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my timeTemptation (is calling your name)
Sweet persuasion, oh (baby this is a game)
Come closer baby (if you like what you hear)
Impassioned (is what I'm making you feel)Cause' I ain't leaving alone, I feel like I could be honest babe
We both know that we're grown
That's why I wanna knowHow many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three
You look good we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my timeAha, and what do we have
Your empty heart and my empty bottle and yellow cab
That you are likely to catch but your latest ex made you mad
So I figured the perfect catch would be you if I made the pass
Pool full of liquor then we dive in it
Knowing if I lick her I might die in it
Then reincarnate as a fly gymnast
Just to flip my tongue on you
This the OlympicsState your name, live in the moment
It's your time to own it, I see it in you baby
She tell me that she never get a first let awayAnd life is a bitch, but every dog has its day
Holla pull up, pull up, bring it back, come rewind
Pull up them bittracks, that pack come behind
Pool full of liquor then we die in it
Pull 'em to the side, let me slide up in itOr waste your time, or waste your time
Or waste our time, baby it's alright
Baby it's alright, baby it's alright yeah
Oh it's alright now
Alright oh yeah
I don't wanna waste my time, no
I don't wanna waste no time, oh no
I don't wanna waste your time, babe
I don't wanna waste our time, oh my time, oh whoa, nowHow many drinks would it take you to leave with me? (oh yeah)
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time (come with me baby)
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three
You look good, we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time, waste my timeNo no no, I ain't judgin' if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
What? More power to you if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
I ain't judgin' if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
What? More power to you if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight 
How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I'm chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
Twenty on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
Twenty years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend 'em a ear or two how to stack these residuals
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do
Twenty on six, he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was slurry
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a silly tan complexion
Asked me for ten grand
Stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, beat it
Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said, my son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me how much a dollar costIt's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breatheHe's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car and tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
A reason why he was mad at a stranger like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
Have you ever opened to Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need
Tell me how much a dollar costIt's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breatheGuilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum, crumbs and pennies
I need all of mines, and I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin'
Keep in mind, when I was strugglin', I did compromise
Now I comprehend, I smell grandpa's old medicine
Reekin' from your skin, moonshine and gin
Nigga your babblin', your words ain't flatterin', I'm imaginin'
Denzel be lookin' at O'Neal
'Cause now I'm in sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre, the jig is up
I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
You looked at me and said, your potential is bittersweet
I looked at him and said, every nickel is mines to keep
He looked at me and said, know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehova, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit, the nerve
Of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am GodI wash my hands, I said my grace, what more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone
Turn this page, help me change, so right my wrongs 
(Verse)
Welcome to the wild side, Hub city's wild side
Where tecs fly that's homicide, my stacks like a mile high
Fly as a bi**h, got a condo on cloud 9
Slap box with God, jump off heaven and skydive
So supernatural K.dot come and see me on Sci-Fi
From 5-6 with five nines two mac-10s and Glock nines
Lets do this however whenever tell em I'm ready
Waters run deep way before Katrina broke the levee
Look partner, I'm no gangster, I'm no killer
But please believe I know plenty gangsters that'll kill ya
I don't like you, I don't feel ya you're very unfamiliar
So please build your catalog before I knock your cattle off
This saddle off on a red horse that's a red Porsche
That's not your favorite rapper in the booth
That's a dead corpse once K.dot kick chaos
Ni**as bi**h off like canines click up and click, click, click boom
Smell the fumes on my Levis
Bitches popping pills and mushrooms in my hotel rooms
I squeeze dick through their thick thighs then bounce like this beat from T.Dot
Six T.Vs in my new SUV f**k you pay me
Or pay me no attention and meet the criminal henchmen
Genesis ain't s**t, I know local henchmen
Come shoot me I'm in a two seater with hootie, motherf**ker(Chorus)
Welcome to the wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Hub city's wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Hub city's wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Hub city's wild side
Where tecs fly, that's homicide
My stacks like a mile high 
Nobody pray for me
Even a day for me
Way (yeah, yeah!)Ay, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits
But now I'm countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives
In fact, I'm downin' this
D'USSÃ with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral

Hey, Hey! Hey! Turn the mic up, c'mon, c'mon
Is the mic on or not? I want the mic
We're bringing up nobody, nobody...
Nobody but the number one rapper in the world
He done traveled all over the world
He came back just to give you some game
All of the little boys and girls, come up here
(One two, one two, what's happening, fool?)
Come right here, this is for you, come on up
Kendrick Lamar, make some noise, brother[Intro]
I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me[Hook]
And (I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, tryna go shine[Verse 1]
They wanna say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme uh
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front)
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, wind could cry now
Look at me motherfucker I smile[Hook]
And (I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, uhh[Verse 2]
(Crazy)
(What you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving, (Keep moving) turn the mic up
(Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, nigga[Hook]
And (I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)[Bridge]
Huh (Walk my bare feet) huh (Walk my bare feet)
Huh (Down, down valley deep) huh (Down, down valley deep)
(I love myself) huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum) huh (fi-fie-fo-fum)
(I love myself) huh (My heart undone) one, two, three[Hook]
And (I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, uhh[Verse 3]
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'mma do it till I get it right
I went to war last night (Night, night, night, night, night)
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body...[Spoken Interlude]
(Offstage Argument)
Not on my time, Not while I'm up here
Not on my time, kill the music
Not on my time
We could save that shit for the streets
We could save that shit, this for the kids bro
2015, niggas tired of playin' victim dog
Niggas ain't trying to play vicâ TuTu, how many niggas we done lost?
Yan-Yan, how many we done lost?
No for real, answer the question, how many niggas we done lost bro?
This, this year alone
Exactly. So we ain't got time to waste time my nigga
Niggas gotta make time bro
The judge make time, you know that, the judge make time right?
The judge make time so it ain't shit
It shouldn't be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left, dawg
On the dead homies. Charlie P, you know that bro
You know that
It's mando. Right, it's mando
And I say this because I love you niggas man
I love all my niggas bro
Exac- enough said, enough said
We gon' get back to the show and move on, because that shit petty my nigga
Mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check
We gon' do some acapella shit before we get back to-
All my niggas listen
Listen to this:[Acapella Verse]
I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase "fuck nigga"
He said, "Think about what you saying: 'Fuck niggas'
No better than Samuel on Django
No better than a white man with slave boats"
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My Pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; King royalty - wait listen
N-E-G-U-S description: Black emperor, King, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlook the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me
Or say no more. Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time
Kendrick Lamar, by far, realest Negus alive 
[Kendrick Lamar]
See y'all don't understand me
My plan B is to win ya hearts before I win a Grammy
Kendrick Lamar, words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan
Marching on Rosecrans in Compton
You can't cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
I'm on point like period
I've been there and gone before you get near it
Ooh wee, that boy remind me of a young Martin Luther
The way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters
Like Malcolm X did, I stand for what I believe in
Family, God and honor
From Chicago, my daddy and my momma
Came to Compton to accomplish one thing
Raise a king, reign supreme, named Kendrick
I ain't lying, it stand for king and I am one
My unborn son and grandson will live royal
From the coochie to the soil
The meek shall inherit the Earth
Well I've had this world since birth
Feel the good kid's hunger
The Crips made strong, the Pirus made stronger
Muscle in my heart
Stare at the eyes of Mozart, then tell him I'm the genius
Do my dougie and grab my penis
Cause I means this with all my soul
And you can't control greatness 'less you hating with the heart of Satan
But even that can't stop it
Nigga, get out my wallet and put passion in your logic
Passion in your life, the passion of my Christ is in me
And if you say it ain't, you may offend me
Damn that boy good
Bright as Thomas Edison, but Gucci man hood
He stood alone for so long
Prolonged his whole career, but now he's here
You can shoot shots or cheer cause I... am 
I want all the kush
I want all the bottles
I want all the cash
I want all the models
I want it all
I want it all[Verse 1: B. Martin]
Ok, kush, bottles, shut up, swallow
Tonight I'm living life like there's no tomorrow
Got a couple girls in the Benz
And they all got friends, headed back to the condo
And I make all they asses clap, clap, clap, bravo
I want that lottery money
That "please don't say hi to me" money
That 'I could go back to my hometown
And get my city outta poverty' money
Don't lie to me honey, I know that thang fake
Put a candle on that ass, tell her "give me that cake", wait
I rep NY, big boy in the big city
Shout out, five burroughs, the upper state, just ride with me
Now come drink on this bottle, and smoke out on this kush
Now let's fade away, and let Juicy go make it rain on that hook
LookI want all the kush
I want all the bottles
I want all the cash
I want all the models
I want it all
I want it allTell him I do Deniro, tell him you do Camaro
I do a fast car, something like a Nascar
Move like a sh-sh-sh-shooting star
And they know who we are, big pimping in the bbuilding
Got about a million, throw it at the ceiling
Layin smack dead in the face of civillians
Tell 'em I'm chilling with Patron on ice
And my home on ice, and my neck on ice
Lo-lo-lo-look at my ring, I'm a hustler string
You should learn me twice
I'mma grind till I die, that's no lie
Do with my middle finger held up high
Fuck the world, if it fry
I know one thing, I did my job
And that's get what? Move, tell a lie
Sippin on Henny, smokin on ly
Never let a penny pass me by
Move with the Benjis by my side
That's my sidekick, you better watch it
What I mean is, don't touch my pockets
Man big debts, cut them checks
Hundred mill plus, nothing lessI want all the kush
I want all the bottles
I want all the cash
I want all the models
I want it all
I want it allTell 'em I do [?], tell 'em they do kius
Tell 'em I got a couple girls in the Benz, and they extra sexy like ES
PN your boy got game, the magic wanna do the vein
Not ready but I'm way Kendrick, so I say F it to all you lames
It's my time, it's my watch, homie
Y'all don't believe me just watch, only
Time will tell but I'll rhyme until I skip time, I'm Michael J. Fox
Got 86 on that dash, got 87 in cash, and I'm born in '88
Born and raised in New York, so you do the math
Pass that dutch, oh
I'mma get a little high now, get a little rush
So I take a little ride to the lower east side, hit the 169
Probably find one girl who was 6'9"
With another girl by the end of the night
I'm her suitor, I can tell the future
I'm [?] same timeI want all the kush
I want all the bottles
I want all the cash
I want all the models
I want it all
I want it allI want all the kush
I want all the bottles
I want all the cash
I want all the models
I want it all
I want it all 
 
[Verse 1:]
Kill him where he stand or stand over him shake his hand
Then jump back in that mini van, double back to his block
And blam I ain't backing down for nothing
I'm a back em down like Shaq with this black 2-2-3 in my hand
Better pray that this chopper jam, like a radio single, man
Police radio signals sayin' that a 187 land on your corner,
Coroners comfort your mama, mama he's dead,
The next morning high toasted up with my homies
We drink and smoke marijuana, want us to change our ways? Uh-huh
You see this game we play come from uncles that raised me in Compton
Ask me what I have accomplished
I don't know I don't have conscience
I just load up and start dumpin' on enemies I'm head hunting
No sympathy, ain't no love when you in these streets just get something
Protect ya neck cause they comin' for set respects split your onion
Then chop your deck your head tumblin' like gymnastics
Cause ignorance is bliss[Verse 2:]
This the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far, from a discharge but never will I dish off
We all tryna ball and when I got the rock I'll dish off
Until the day I pistol whip you posers till ya'll pissed off
Then peel off, in a hooptie
Come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me
And they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
Indubitably I'm too street
Indubitably I'm a do me
Better than your bitch would
But you niggas too weak, but just give me 2 weeks
And I'm good
I'll make an album that'll put a smile on Malcolm
Make Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven's talent
No tarot card reading I'm foreseeing you niggas vanish
Not only from the rap game, I'm including the planet
Cats so watered down clowns can sink Titanic
Tie titanium around their neck and watch em panic
Give me respect, dammit, or get damaged
Die young, corpse identified by your parents
Apparently you a parrot
Mocking me and my blueprint
But I won't share it just make you cop it then call you a sheriff
Stop it, I'm hearin' the comments
The critics are calling me conscious
But truthfully, every shooter be callin' me Compton
So truthfully, only calling me Kweli and Common?
Proves, that ignorance is bliss[Verse 3:]
And this still the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far, from a discharge but never will I dish off
This my world, I grab the universe then play kickball
And they wonder why these California earthquakes hit so hard
I'm so-Cal, you so called
Rappers need to go call
Ghostbusters to shoot busters I'm Casper when I go off
I show up, to show out to show off
You a hundred percent behind me
And if you hard then wreck your car and walk up to my crime scene
I remember being 17 wishing someone would sign me
Now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me
Backin' down boggins
Backin' down bitches
We gon' flip her once she off that blue dolphin
You gon' tip her
Cause ignorance is bliss
And Willy B I'm a fool on yo beats, I bleed out the speaker
As the speaker that spoke when they done speak 
What money got to do with it
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit
Hol' up
Get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
Who ever thought?
Master take the chains off meLife can be like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
A dream's only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle would do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to the fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artists like the harvests
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened what my grandmama said to meShit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Oh now, slow downAnd once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was 5 foot something, God bless the kid
Took his homie to the show and this is what they saidFuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The convicts talk 'bout matchin', money and foreign whips
The private jets and passports, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, sniffin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suck a dick, fuck is this?
One more suck away from wavin' flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him, quickly because he got it
It's the recession, then why the fuck he in King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my .44
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well that's me at these awards
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She saidShit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Oh now, slow downAnd once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was 5 foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood but you can't take the hood out the homie
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywood's nervous
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service 
Whats wrong nigga?
I thought you was keeping it gangsta?
I thought this what you wanted?
They say if you scared go to church
But remember
He knows the bible tooMy baby when I get you get you get you get you
I'ma go head to ride with you
Smoking lokin' poking the deja till I'm idle with you
Cause I (want you)
Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving
Cause I (want you)
I want you more than you knowI remember you took me to the mall last week baby
You looked me in my eyes about 4 5 times
Till I was hypnotized then you clarified
That I (want you)
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy
I said you crazy
Roses are red violets are blue but me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you)My baby when I get you get you get you get you
I'ma go head to ride with you
Smoking lokin' poking the deja till I'm idle with you
Cause I (want you)You said to me
You said your name was Lucy
I said where's Ricardo?
You said oh no, not the show
Than you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned 26 I was like oh shit
You said to me
I remember what you said too, you said
"My name is Lucy, Kendrick
You introduced me Kendrick
Usually I don't do this
But I see you and me Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries
Lucy got million stories
About these rappers I came after when they was boring
Lucy gone fill your pockets
Lucy gone move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty
Avoiding me?
It's not so easy I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute
Lucy work harder
Lucy gone call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy
I loosely heard prayers on your first album truly
Lucy don't mind cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paper work on top of paper work
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up then sign this contract if that's possible"Get you get you get you get you
I'ma go head to ride with you
Smoking lokin' poking the doja till I'm idle with you
Cause I (want you)
Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving
Cause I (want you)I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Until I came home 
 
 
Fancy girls on Long Beach Blvd
Flagging down all of these flashy carsAnd Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving a body sore
She take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles,
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
She play Mr. Shakur
That's her favorite rapper bumping "Brenda's Got A Baby"
While a pervert yelling at her and she capture features of a woman
But only 17, the 7 cars start honkin'
She start running like FLo-Jo don't care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars
She give all to her daddy but she don't know her father,
That's ironic see a block away from Lueders park, I seen the El Camino parked
In her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meetFancy girls on Long Beach Blvd
Flagging down all of these flashy carsAnd Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals, leaving a body sore
Her anatomy is God's temple, and it's quite simple
Her castle is about to be destroyed, she's always paranoid
Watching the law inside the streets undercover the dummies that look like decoys
Remember the sergeant let her slide,
Said if he seen what's between her thighs he'd compromise,
To no surprise she took the ultimatum around the alleyway and gave him
A warm welcome to fill him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
And in her heart, she hate it there but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she topping off policeFancy girls on Long Beach Blvd
Flagging down all of these flashy carsAnd Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals, leaving a body sore
As she bust down like a 12 bunk on tour
She suddenly realized she'll never escape the allure
Of the black man, white man, needed satisfaction, at first
It became a practice, but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners' redemption
That sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother
For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
Ten months before she was ten he moved in and that's when he touched her
This muthafucka is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing through that
Block away from Lueders park, I seen a El Camino park
And in her heart she hate it there but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
And caught a knife inside the bladder, left her dead, raped in the street Keisha's songMy little sister eleven, I looked her right in the face
The day that I wrote this song, set her down and pressed playFancy girls on Long Beach Blvd
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
Fancy girls on Long Beach Blvd oh
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

Every member of rap's Mount Rushmore dropped new albums in 2013-Kanye, Jay Z, Drake, Eminem-but it was another MC altogether who stole the crown, and he did it with just a handful of verses: Kendrick Lamar, the latest-and possibly greatest-rapper to come straight outta Compton.We are 10,000 feet above Compton in a private jet, and Kendrick Lamar is explaining to me what happened to him yesterday, when he vanished. We had a plan: Kendrick was going to give me a guided, cue-the-G-funk-synth Star Maps tour of his neighborhood, the one he still more or less lives in, starting at his parents' house a couple of blocks from his old high school, Centennial High, near the corner of Piru and South Central. Instead, he went AWOL. The whole day, no one from his label, Interscope, or Top Dawg Entertainment, the baby Death Row Records that originally signed him, could track him down. Kendrick was gone.
It turned out he was sitting shivah for a murdered friend he calls his "little bro"-a kid from a neighborhood where friendship is defined primarily by neighborhood. A few weeks earlier, Chad Keaton, 23, had been wounded in a drive-by shooting very close to Kendrick's parents' house. He held on for a month but ultimately died of complications from the gunshot wounds.
So today, here on board this Challenger 300 seven-seater, en route to New York City's fall Fashion Week, a destination filled with people Kendrick isn't sure whether he wants to impress or fuck with, he's telling me about Chad. "It all happened when I was overseas," he says. "I had to talk to him over Skype on the hospital bed before he passed."
It's been a strange year. When it began, Kendrick was already regarded as something of a messiah among rap nerds-one of the best rappers ever to come out of the place that has produced many of the best rappers ever-and since then his legend has spread fast.
It actually began late last year, when Kendrick's major-label-debut album, good kid, m.A.A.d city,dropped, to universal acclaim. The album-about a day in the life of nerdy Compton teenager K.Dot and his homeys as they run around in his mom's minivan chasing "that crazy-ass girl Sherane"-is practically a black Ulysses: a portrait of the rapper as a young man, simultaneously a drive-by deconstruction of gangster rap's violent tropes and a celebration of its signature, slow-rolling sound. On good kid, Lamar is our embedded correspondent, spitting triple-time confessionals from a part of the country most of us had forgotten once the rap scene found a fresher inner city to fetishize. He's the game's most linguistically cerebral MC, but also its realest-the one who finds the most vivid way to tell a story about his unemployed buddies trying to rope him into robbing some dude's house-and it's this polarity that makes listening to King Kendrick feel like you're putting on the illest 3-D glasses in hip-hop. The music nods at influences far beyond the West Coast-Beach House samples, Dungeon Family lushness-but throughout, his voice stays singularly focused on a twenty-block radius around Central Avenue and Piru Street:
If Pirus and Crips all got along They'd probably gun me down by the end of this songGood kid, m.A.A.d city sold an industry-shocking 241,000 copies its first week and went platinum this summer. Then, in August, Kendrick snuck a sixty-four-bar Trojan horse into his buddy Big Sean's song "Control"-a guest spot on a song that didn't even make the final record. After Big Sean goes on for a while about drinking champagne in Detroit, Kendrick wakes up the entire hip-hop universe, calling out nearly every single young rapper in the game: Drake; A$AP Rocky; J. Cole; Tyler, the Creator; even Big Sean himself. The dude slaps Sean on his own song. He also proclaimed himself "the king of New York," which to certain East Coast ears sounded like a Greek dude strolling into Troy and dropping a deuce on the tomb of Hector.
"Control" leaked on YouTube late in the day on August 12; for a solid week, it was the biggest story in music. Just a few weeks after that, Kanye announced he was touring solo for the first time in five years and that his opening act would be Kendrick Lamar.
Kendrick's career momentum has created a dissonance that must look surreal from 30,000 feet. Chad Keaton's memorial service was held just before Labor Day weekend; Kendrick attended, then flew straight to a show in Alaska. Next it was on to Vegas to perform at a pool party. He only made it "back to the set" to grieve for a single day, the day we were scheduled to talk. "It can be complicated and confusing," Kendrick says of his life right now, funerals for murdered friends one day, private jets to fashion parties the next. "From my perspective, it's not just I'm famous-I still live in this world." And when someone back home needs something, "I still gotta get that phone call."
It's clear the emotions are still raw. Kendrick is a small guy, just five feet six, and with his black hood pulled up over his head, a chain around the outside of his sweatshirt, it felt like I was talking to a wizened rap Jedi. After about an hour of questions, I gave him a break, and he lay down on the couch to rest. Just kind of curled up with his back turned.
A bit later, I saw a tweet from him to his 2.4 million followers pop up on my phone: "When the cameras stop rolling, it doesn't mean real life will follow." Instantly it had fifty-six retweets. After one minute, 600. After two minutes, 1,000. Then he tweeted a picture of Chad: "Rest N Heaven my Lil bro. Watched u become a man. U fought bro. The city stole yo life, but not your legacy."On the night of the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, just as the heat over "Control" was peaking, I tailed Kendrick through the backstage maze at Brooklyn's Barclays Center. At one point, he ran into Drake, and they wrapped each other up in a big hug. It was their first encounter since Kendrick called him out on "Control," and of all the slaps in that verse, this one felt the most personal, because Drake had helped break Kendrick, handing the kid not just a verse but an entire song on his second album. After Drake's VMA performance of "Hold On, We're Going Home," Kendrick made his way back to the greenroom, crooning the hook: I got my eyes on you.... He caught mine and smiled. "You watch," he joked, "I'm going to be singing by my fifth album!"
I asked if this meant things were cool between him and Drake. He paused. "Pretty cool." Shrugs. "And I mean, I would be okay if we weren't."
A month later, it became apparent that things between Kendrick and Drake were definitely not cool. After Drake's new album dropped, he gave a pair of interviews in which he sounded wounded by the "Control" thing: "You can't just say that and then see me and be like, 'Yeah, man, what's up?'-pretending like nothing ever happened." Seemingly in response, during the BET Hip-Hop Awards cypher a few weeks later, Kendrick freestyled: Nothing been the same since they dropped "Control" / and tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes.
I got Kendrick on the phone after the BET taping, and he admitted to being surprised by Drizzy's public lash-out-"Control" named names, sure, but at its core it was a backhanded tribute to the peers Kendrick actually gives a shit about. Most of them took it in that spirit. Not Drake. "Yeah, I guess he took it as a dis," Kendrick said, downplaying talk of a beef. But he was also clear that he doesn't look up to Drake, doesn't see him as any kind of creative influence. When I asked if Drake was a mentor or a role model, he replied quickly, "No-peer. If anything. We all peers."When Kendrick Lamar was 21, 2Pac appeared to him in a vision. Before you roll your eyes, Lamar wants you to know that he's not the hermit-on-the-edge-of-the-Nitrian-Desert, vision-seeing type. He knows how this sounds.
"I was coming from a late studio session, sleeping on Mom's couch. I'm 26 now-it wasn't that long ago. I remember being tired, tripping from the studio, lying down, and falling into a deep sleep and seeing a vision of Pac talking to me. Weirdest shit ever. I'm not huge on superstition and all that shit. That's what made it so crazy. It can make you go nuts. Hearing somebody that you looked up to for years saying, 'Don't let the music die.' Hearing it clear as day. Clear as day. Like he's right there. Just a silhouette."
The visit from Pac changed Kendrick's connection to the world he was chronicling in his music and compelled him to think more carefully about who was listening to it. "It wasn't just about money, hoes, clothes, drinkin'," he explains. "I mean, I come from that world, but at the same time, I started to realize that there's people out there that can't really connect to that lifestyle. They're in the struggle."
Much of Kendrick's music now is an attempt to transcend his ravaged world without separating himself from it in judgment, about somehow gaining control over his household's chaos-some of his uncles were Crips, and his father was reportedly a Gangster Disciple in Chicago before moving to Compton-and over his neighborhood's warped commitment to adolescent pride. It's an ethos that extends to his crew. They have a seriousness of purpose, a rigorous discipline that can feel slightly monastic at times. Kendrick doesn't smoke weed or drink booze. In the time I spent with him, I never witnessed anyone roll even the thinnest spider leg of a jay, nor did I see Kendrick so much as glance at the many, many girls around him. "When I ask OGs why there's so much division in the streets-nobody never really knows," he says. "But you know one thing that everybody always mention? A woman."
A few hours after the VMAs, we were back in Kendrick's hotel room and everybody was in a lull, staring at cell phones, waiting for news about afterparties. A plan coalesced to hit a party being thrown by Diddy at the Dream Downtown hotel. But one of Kendrick's Top Dawg boys leaned back and said, "Aw, man, I can't go to no club."
Kendrick spoke up.
"We have to go."
"Look at you! We have to go. You're never we have to go."
"You know me," Kendrick explained. "I only go when there's a point. Usually the point is just niggas drinking. But walking through the club the week after I released the 'Control' verse? That's a point!"
Twenty minutes later, Anthony "Top Dawg" Tiffith, basically TDE's Suge Knight, asked if I had had a fun day. I said that I had and that I was surprised by their discipline. "You guys seem so calm," I said.
"Well," Tiffith told me, "we're going to have to call it a night with you, because we about to get uncalm. You understand."
The gossip from Diddy's Ciroc Amaretto Launch Party/VMA Afterparty sounded like it fell out of a massive tear in the mid-'90s West Coast-East Coast time wave. Bloggers breathlessly recounted a surreal scene at Dream: booths packed with hip-hop illuminati-Jay, Bey-mouths agape as a wasted Diddy, incensed by the "King of New York" boast, attempted to pour a drink (Ciroc Amaretto, presumably) over Kendrick's head, only to be thwarted by Jay Z acolyte J. Cole, who was kicked out in the ensuing chaos. Naturally Kendrick himself refused to corroborate any of this. "It was all love at that party," he told me on the private jet.
After we land at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, I catch a ride with Kendrick into Manhattan. His show tonight is a New York Fashion Week kickoff party in Chelsea thrown by industry doyenne JennÃ© Lombardo, and in the car he goofs around, imagining the horror he and his Compton homeys could inspire: "We invited Kendrick Lamar, not K.Dot and them Piru niggas."
By the end of his forty-minute set, the crowd is pretty fucked-up. There's chronic in the air; models are tottering in their heels. When Kendrick launches into the call-and-response for "Swimming Pools (Drank)," a song about his family's dark relationship with chemical dependency-Head shot. DRANK. Sit down. DRANK. Stand up. DRANK-a wraithlike six-foot blonde with a white veil dances around a little coven of models. There is something demonic about the scene: Kendrick recounting his fever dreams about the grim consequences of decadence while presiding over a decadent Fashion Week party.
It's hard to guess how scenes like this will change Kendrick and his music. Sometime in January, he will step into Top Dawg's booth again, and he expects to be just as surprised as the rest of us by what comes out. "I don't know," he says. "It depends on where my emotion is. How angry I'll be, or how happy I'll be, or how confused I'll be."
At one point on good kid Kendrick raps, "I can feel the changes / I can feel a new life / I always knew life can be dangerous". The biggest change in Kendrick's life is the inversion of rap's consummate observer becoming the observed. How will all eyez on him affect his art? Because he's already 10,000 feet above Compton, and rising.

What's my purpose? Maybe this Earth is
Ain't a good place to be
How far is heaven? Let's see
Is it in the clouds like they said it would be?
I wonder when I die
Will he give me receipts?
I wonder will the eyes of the lord look at me?
Look at me, look at me, I'm a loser, I'm a winner
I'm good, I'm bad, I'm a Christian, I'm a sinner
I'm humble, I'm loud, I'm righteous, I'm a killer

My plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons
I'm dying inside, I wonder if Zion inside the heavens
A condom, a rollie, pain, a fat blunt and a mack 11
That's all I see in my life and they tell me to make it right
But I"m right on the edge of Everest and I might jump tonight
Have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinner's advice?
Well it's probably you, am I right? If I'm wrong, you a fucking lie
When I lie on back and look at the ceiling, it's so appealing to pray
I wonder if I'm just a villain, dealing my morals away
Some people look at my face then tell me don't worry about it
I give em back they deposit, no money, just total silence
I'm running, they say I'm wildin' a youngin' with lack of guidance
That's hundreds of us with problems: more money, more drugs and violence
Look at the soul of an out-of-control artist
That's dealing with life the hardest
That's on my life, but regardless I'maRide to it, ride to it

Let's be straight, to the pointYea, life can please ya
But death can tease ya
On the day Niko had that seizure
I lost one of my biggest believers
Close deaths make you think about your life
Like if I had that same chance twice
What would I do different?
I'd tell her I loved her more
Do more
But tease her bout crying on that picture
Now when I'm done recording
Swear I let the beat bang in her name
Make her shake her head in heaven saying
They at it again
Make them clouds turn to speakers
Don't take too much smoke from the reefer
Love being in the room with her peoples
Now my love life murking it
Family having surgeries
Hate it that the truth that chose for they life to be under me
Lord, what kind of life is this?
Mama I just wanna sing
Mama said, "According to get everything
You gotta risk everything"
So I'm smoking my kush reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush reading Corinthians 
[Hook]
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a ginnsu
Look at the life that I been through
We the last real niggas alive, that's official[Kendrick Lamar]
Let me tell you when it all started
Game dropped Documentary and made plenty enemies
It was a classic album, but prior to that
Guerilla Black debuted and put the city on wax
A lot of Biggie comparisons, we all was aware of them
But that wasn't my M.O., I just thought he was dope
Can't understand why Game would say his name in that manner
Many years went by, still no legitimate answer
Anyway, I put out a mixtape in 12th grade
Hub City threat, minor of the year, DJ Dave
And his brother designed, put together the music
Put it out to the people, the people said I was stupid
With the flow, went to the barbershop to show off my skills
Mike and Himey and some other cat said I was real
Himey was Games barber, the other cat made a statement
Saying that Game was his partner, so I gave him my tape
Said he'd play it for him, hoping that I'd get my big break
But never got a response.. anyway
This nigga named ?Pop Givs? came to my school with a camera
I freestyled on his DVD for a minute then after
It hit the streets, I was known as K. Dot from Compton
Man Hootie probably was the youngest out that was poppin'
But I didn't have a home yet, Hootie had ? in me
Until I met Top Dawg, told Dave that he'd like to meet
Me at the studio, made me freestyle for an hour
Told me come back tomorrow, but I came back in a hour
Jay Rock was in the booth, recording his first mixtape
Was skeptical homie at first because he knew where I stayed
But we got over that, heard the beat, wrote a rap
Did our first collaboration on the Nephew track
He got signed months later, Warner Brothers
We started on his album, he wrote his rhymes on paper
Before Sidekicks became a modern day phone
Same time our buzz was generated from G Malone
He had a song called 200, White Lightnin, the streets loved it
Said that Sony had gave him an unbelievable budget
Now that's a smart nigga, I'm tryna make my raps bigger than life
But not knowing how to market it right
Turned on the radio
Only cat he knew from the West Coast was playin' was Bishop
And by then this nigga' buzz was tremendous
In the lab, me and Rock tryna perfect our craft
What the fuck? Next thing you know, we came across Lift Me Up
It was a hit
When I heard it
But all we had was the instrumental and the hook
But when
Rock jump on it for certain, it was to smash
Gave it to Julio, just to get his opinion
Next thing you know, the record was
Spinning
That was a good look, it set the coast on fire
Niggas in Garden projects presents Watts Riot
Then these rappers start hating, callin' up to the station
Ask why they record ain't playin', what you niggas complaining, about?
Shit was funny to us tho
Niggas hate to see a nigga from the bottom come up, yo
In the midst of the single poppin' and niggas tryna seek and destroy
I had a situation with Def Jam, premature
Shit went sour after Jay-Z left but they didn't care
I was glad Jay-Z gave me respect
See I was young, fast forward, hot dollah had the streets on lock
Far as radio play, obvious, he got a lot
Beefing' with Daz Dilinger, Jay Rock spoke on it
Which in my opinion, I didn't think the shit was impo'tant
But that's a whole 'nother story, we hit the lab with Game
And a few other names like Juice and Young, ya boy
Did the cypher freestyle and everybody's like, "Wow"
These Top Dawg niggas 'bout to make noise"
Surely after Game took us on tour, I love you for that
But right after that, we didn't see him no more
G Malone came with a smash hit with Akon
Mistah FAB battled Royce Nickel with napalm
Then everybody start to scream out the new West
And claim that West Coast legends don't want to see him at best
I think that's just an excuse, because their music ain't tight
Tell 'em that Ab-soul said it, they can quote him twice
Then Crooked I came with Hip-Hop Weekly, killin' the internet
But he been a threat since Deathrow, then Rocky came about
And all I thought about was Ab-Soul 2-11-2
It finally started to look like the West was makin' moves
Western Union had the whole block boomin' because of Snoop
Matter fact, Bad Luck was my favorite about the group
Then ?Problem? took off, another Compton native
We both Compton niggas, but Compton still ain't made it
By this time, Jay Rock and All My Life hit the airwaves
We almost got into some major beef over Lil' Wayne
That part I'mma leave out
Theres certain things that the streets only should know about
Shout out to Nipsey
Bishop win that game, then had a fight with ?
That's when I dropped C4 and had the critics mad at me
Because they didn't see my views, grab the hottest album out and re-do it
That's a goddamn power move stupid
You foolish, don't know shit about this war shit
Theres mo' shit to wanting to be the king of the coast shit[Hook x2][Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
So two weeks ago I finally run into the nigga I gave my mixtape too
And said he was partners with Game
The nigga finally told me what he said
He said he didn't like it
But the niggas like
"See, see, look at you, look at you now, I tried to tell him you was tight"
Nigga probably never even gave it to him and shit 
We on Ali? You ugly
Everybody just clap your hands if you're real
Middle finger up, give a fuck how they feel
Be yourself, just show me you're real
Middle fingers up[Chorus]
Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
(That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's-that's the only way I know how to hold it down)Uh, I just wanna be me
No disrespect, but motherfuck you
My education stopped at a high school degree
but I can outsmart any high IQ
Draped in some fly shit, call me Jeff Goldblum
Cold, my style making my nose run
Oh, I stare at the mirror, then realize
that real lies, within me
Some say I'm crazy cause I think like I need a shrink
Ask too many questions about the stars and Earth shit
Rather be in the studio than out buying drinks
So if I'm not clubbing, don't think I'm on some jerk shit
And California on that jerk shit
But I'd just rather two-step like my first steps
Jill Scott in my iPod as my head rests, yes[Chorus]And yeah I know I'm from Compton, Cali'
But I don't lace up Chucks or rock tan khakis
And skinny jeans ain't quite the lick
I probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit
Ha-ha-ha, I like to joke, got a sense of humor?
Stale face, play me short like an Oompa-Loompa
You ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids
Won't you lighten up like Michael did?
I grew up with killers man, people who killed man
But my character never could be like them man
And they respect that, say that I'm real man
Not a fake person, that's the Sims man
Live my life through some film man?
I ain't acting out shit, I be packing out shows
cause they know they'll know Kendrick fo' sho', and oh[Chorus]Almost lost my life to the industry
Had to look through a photo book to remember me
These label heads ain't nothing but bullshit
Have you with professional killers, chasing hits
Lying to yourself all over an image
Making records they want, that was wrecking my brilliance
My mama said, boy that don't sound like you
I said, this is the sound though, my only excuse
Quite frankly, dusted off my shoes with my hankie
and kicked it like he skate, make these motherfuckers hate me
The reason why they hate, cause these motherfuckers ain't me
And you can underrate me, but I know what I'm worth
A diamond in God's dirt, a diamond in winter
Watching Simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner
See I give you my life to mix it up in a blender
to make sure that you feel it[Chorus][uncredited female]
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Is this really you? Is this who you are?
What are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Who are you?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?I think that I finally reached the pinnacle
of finding myself as an individual
The world is so typical
I just wanna be higher than that
I used to want to be the messiah of rap
Infatuated with becoming a relevant star
Trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars
that I never had, but wrote it in my raps to make you mad
Vanity, they say that it can damage me
So do I really want it?
If I didn't, I guess I'm a cool cocaine connect
That means I'll be fronting, hmm
Cooking in a laboratory, hoping I can tell a story
that the whole world can feel, like the ones that came before me
Knowing that I'm misunderstood
So I gotta get my point across like a snitch would
And I would never walk in the shadow that never was really there
or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair
And Dame said he proud of my newfound honesty
and all I could say is, will the radio care?
Yeah, or should I say no?
Or should I just stop and come with a whole new approach?
You heard my Hip Hop when I was sixteen years old
Well that was me then, now I'm an adult
Twenty-two like the smallest of guns that you know, most determined
but with the smallest of funds to show, but I'm not worried
My talent should take me places I've never been
The world should turn soon as my record spin
I wanna be the highest, on top of all the bullshit
The negative you bring, the stress, the violence
The capital punishment, the loud police sirens
Too focussed, one word, righteous
And this is Kendrick Lamar
and soon y'all know cloud nine y'all
And that means I wanna be the highest
Too focussed, one word (righteous)
Mm, yeah
That means I wanna be the highest
Too focussed, one word[uncredited female]
Too focussed, too focussed, one word
Too focussed, too focussed, one word
Too focussed, too focussed, one word
Too focussed, one word
Too focussed, too focussed, one word 
Look inside my eyes and tell me you see a warrior

Homie I got love for him
Angel on angel dust, I used to thug for him
Took me on my first mission, transition
Good kid turned rapper, pay attention
This is deeper than you think
Right after my admission inside the game, asked him bout whats his name
We brushed it off as a joke as we watched her get off the stage
Music award fight for all of the nominee
I was promised to win, he was promised to leave 
I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too high to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heart beat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in
"It's okay," she said, "It's okay"Yeah, I need everybody's motherfuckin' hands up right now
I need everybody's motherfuckin'
Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
This that new, new shitWake up in the mornin' thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
Don't go to work today, cop you a fit
Or maybe some kicks and make you

Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with your homies, stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club, or your mama house
Whatever you doin' just make it count
I need some water
Wake up in the mornin' thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touchin' yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make him pay your rent
Hop on the 'gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce

"It's okay," she said, "It's okay"I wake in the mornin', my head spinnin' from the last night
Both in the trance, feelings I did, what a fast life
Manager called, the lobby called, it's 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money, call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap and do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, and the feeling's deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Still and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin', things change
Revertin' back to our daily programs
Stuck in our ways, lustLately, I feel like I been lusting over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately, lately, lately my lust been hiding (Lately)
Lately, it's all contradiction
Lately I'm not here
Lately, I lust over self
Lust turn into fear
Lately, in James 4:4 says
Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord

If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear"Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!""Man down
Where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain
It was Me, O-Boog[?], and Yaya[?], YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, waving your hand out the window. Check yo self
Uh, warriors and Conans
Hope euphoria can slow dance with society
The driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where hang out
Now this is not a tape recording saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin at him different
That was back when I was nine
Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine
We adapt to crime, pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin up you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump
Pickin' off you suckers, suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from
AK's, AR's, "Aye y'all. Duck."
That's what momma said when we was eatin the free lunch
Aw man, God damn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94. Fuck yo truce
Now crawl yo head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces
BG's up to pre-approve, bodies on top of bodies
IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley
Make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a Tec
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d city"Man down
Where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear"Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!Wake yo punk ass up!
It ain't nothin but a Compton thang
Chyea
Real simple and plain
I'mma teach you some lessons about the street
It ain't nothin but a Compton thang
Chyea
How we doFresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two nigga's hopped out on foot and dashed
My Pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
In fact I got fired because I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
Kendrick AKA Compton's human sacrificeCocaine, weed
Nigga's been mixing shit since the 80's loc
Sherm sticks, butt nakeds
Make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis
I'm still in the hood
Loc yeah that's cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately
Couple of IV's with the fucking spray can
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, harsh turn brave
Mount up regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where motherfuckers standIf I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick that you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now & Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul de sac hostage
Kill them all if they gossip, the Children of the Corn
They realizing the option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye; this a coward, the concept is aim and
They bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits
And the price on his head, the tithes probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough
Compton, U.S.A. made me an angel on angel dust, what 
 
Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup

Get some ambition, why you bored?
Time'll never wait on no man
Society will never hold your hand
Niggas like the gossip, like bitches
Got me thinking you don't like bitches
Wonder what's behind them Ray Bans
Eyes of a coward, I understand
Niggas like the gossip, like bitches
Sip Don Perignon, when we finish, we say
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep, R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep

Ay, in my apartment a long time ago
I knew a bad bitch, but she was kind of slow
Still gave it up when it's a few of us
She let me finger fuck her on the school bus
We used to cut school with her and run train
She want to hang with us, we want one thing
Just penetrating that throat dog
She choke on it like Smoke Dog
But whenever I fucked up my re-up
In a dice game I go see her
She'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce
And then blow a blunt of that reefa'
She used to buy a nigga new sneakers
Pay the bill on my beeper
Just so she can pay to put a "69"
And I know what time to go freak her
Then one day I just asked her
"Why you always give your ass up?
I mean damn these hoes get paid
All you do is get laid, this shit don't add up."
She said, "Tip, all I wanna do is feel love
Even if I know it ain't real love
Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it
Then never call back, I still fuck"
And that's fucked up, she's so trill
I need somethin', she go steal
When the trap hot and police ride
Nigga, guess where we go chill?
For 'bout four years she held dope
And my four pounds till' it goes down
I remember shawty, she stayed down
I won't say her name because she married nowWhen the lights go out and I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head oh
All of the things that I did back then
Oh when I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had oh
All of the things that I did back thenShe would always turn heads when she'd fall through
She would always make moves how a boss do
And she never gave any nigga time of day
But she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to
But when it came to me, she had a thing for me
When we kick it she roll up the weed for me
And we'd both cut class post up in the cut steady
Watching just to see if the police coming
We got close over time, her and I
Right around the time that I first got signed
Come to think about it I was 'bout 17
I ain't even have a license, couldn't even drive
I was going back and forth with these flights
Another show after show, each night
She became so suspicious of these other bitches
She'd go through my phone and we'd fight
Talk about torn between the two
Wasn't really much more that we could do
Wasn't really much space for us
But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
But I guess one night I had a few
Huh, one night I had a few
Yeah, this little chick that caught my eye
I told her "hurry up, meet me at the room"
And no, I didn't have a contraceptive
And my common sense neglected
And two months later next thing I know
I got a text that said "I'm pregnant"
And you can almost bet she kept it
That's the reason why you left me
On top of all that, it wasn't even mine
I went and got paternity tested, damn!When the lights go out and I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head oh
All of the things that I did back then
Oh when I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had oh
All of the things that I did back thenWait, hold up, is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
Jay 3-0-5 had gave me high five
When I said I'm in hot pursuit
You said I won't ride until Kendrick drive
A new Monte Carlo that cruise
And that shot my pride, I tried to improv'
But no freestyle I never do
You looking for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti
You overlooking every nigga that ain't quite ready
To make it rain on you like about to break a levee
Hold up, that pussy petty
Yeah, your nails did, your hair did
Your cell phone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with a Hummer
Her new prima donna I smelt it
Tried to make you mine, ho!
Tried to make some time, ho!
But I ain't got the time or the patience
To stop and wait in line, ho!
Her dreams holds Versace
She fall for Armani
Only deal with rich niggas
Fuck you and Mitt Romney
I'm grown now I'm on my own now
I'm po'ppin'
Change my phone now
When I get home now
I got o'ptions
Fast forward, wait is that you?
With them big old thighs after school?
And your 3 kids and 3 baby daddies
And car note that's overdue? I knowWhen the lights go out and I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head oh
All of the things that I did back then
Oh when I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had oh
All of the things that I did back then 
Oh shit!
Oh, I need that
I need that sloppy
That sloppy
Like a Chevy in quicksand
That sloppyThis feelin' is unmatched
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black [Pendleton] ball cap
(West, west, west)
We don't share the same synonym fall back
(West, west, west)
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radio's nemesis may be wack
My innocence limited the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer but I did it in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin' scratchin' dilligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sittin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision
Kendrick is master that mastered it
Isn't it lovely how menace has turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque
But what's better than that?
The fact it brought me back homeWe been waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for youI know everything, I know everything, know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything, I know Compton
I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious, I know everything
I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's Ornery
I know everything, the highs the lows the groupies the junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision
I know you know that lines from Compton School District
Just give it to the kids, don't gossip about how it was distributed
I know how people work, I know the price of life
I know how much it's worth, I know what I know and I know it well
Not to ever forget until I realized I didn't know shit
The day I came homeWe been waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for youI met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro, gap in his smile
Hand me down sneakers bounced through the crowd
Runnin' home and the man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin' on his beady beads exhausted
Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles
Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin'
He looked at me and said Kendrick you do know my language
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted
Oh I forgot don't kill my vibe, that's right you're famous
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was takin'
But never mind you're here right now don't you mistake it
It's just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family's ancestor

Nigga I am Compton
A big ass condom, mothafuck LAPD, DA, and your honor got pumped up on Alondra
Trap my body, free my mind
Hoping ya'll could see the sign 
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this questionWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan (one two, one two)
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this questionWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug kid or see me as K. Lamar
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing
But a prophet ain't a prophet til they ask you this question:When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask you friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with thatDo you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon' stick around if them twenty-five years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt?
You think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the first?
Can you be immortalized without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time?
Like who got your best interest? Like how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in, do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing
What kind of bridge did they burn, revenge or your mind when it's mentioned?
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in in his shoes but you peace-making seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone, this your lesson for everyone, sayWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask you friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?The voice of Mandela, hope these flows they propel it
Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you ridin' with me niggaI been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you
That's not Nelson-like, want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben's Island analyzing, that's where his cell is
So I could find clarity, like how much you cherish me
Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow
Murphy's Law, generation X, will I ever be your ex?
Floss off a baby step, mobbed by the mouth a bit
Pause, put me under stress
Crawled under rocks, ducking y'all, it's respect
But then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left 'em for dead?
Is it Moses, is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther, JFK, shooter you assassin
Is it Jackie, is it Jesse, oh I know, it's Michael Jackson, ohWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us Billie Jean, you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question niggaI remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivor's guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mines
Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don't know, I'm no mortal man, maybe I'm just another niggaShit and that's all I wrote
I was gonna call another nigga but, it ain't really a poem,
I just felt like it's something you probably could relate to
Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you,
I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa
About a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground
What you mean 'bout that, what the ground represent?The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
That's how I see it, my word is bond.
I see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people,
The poor people is gonna open up this whole world
And swallow up the rich people
'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat, they gonna be so appetizing,
You know what I'm saying, wealthy, appetizing
The poor gonna be so poor and hungry
You know what I'm saying it's gonna be like
There might be some cannibalism out this mutha, they might eat the richAight so let me ask you this then,
Do you see yourself as somebody that's rich
Or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities?I see myself as a natural born hustler,
A true hustler in every sense of the word, I took nothin'
I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job
And built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it
I went from having somebody manage me
To me hiring the person that works my management company
I changed everything I realized my destiny in a matter of five years
You know what I'm saying I made myself a millionaire
I made millions for a lot of people now it's time to make millions for myself,
You know what I'm saying
I made millions for the record companies,
I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for usAnd through your different avenues of success
How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?By my faith in God, by my faith in the game,
And by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true
You know what I'm saying, and it was happening to me for a reason
You know what I'm saying, I was noticing,
I was punching the right buttons and it was happening
So it's no problem, you know I mean it's a problem but I'm not finna let them know
I'm finna go straight throughWould you consider yourself a fighter at heart
Or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?I like to think that at every opportunity
I've ever been threatened with resistance it's been met with resistance
And not only me but it goes down my family tree
You know what I'm saying, it's in my veins to fight backAight well, how long you think it take before niggas be like,
We fighting a war, I'm fighting a war I can't win and I wanna lay it all downIn this country a black man only have like five years we can exhibit maximum strength
And that's right now while you a teenager
While you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights,
While you still wanna shoot back
'Cause once you turn thirty it's like they take the heart and soul out of a man
Out of a black man in this country
And you don't wanna fight no more
And if you don't believe me you can look around,
You don't see no loud mouth thirty-year old muthafuckasThat's crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind
I can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil goin' on
So I wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today?I think that niggas is tired-a grabbin' shit out the stores
And next time it's a riot there's gonna be bloodshed for real
I don't think America can know that
I think American think we was just playing and it's gonna be some more playing
But it ain't gonna be no playing
It's gonna be murder, you know what I'm saying,
It's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this muthafucka
You know what I'm saying, it's gonna happenThat's crazy man. In my opinion only hope that we kinda have left
Is music and vibrations
Lotta people don't understand how important it is
Sometimes I be like, get behind a mic
And I don't know what type of energy I'mma push out,
Or where it comes from. Trip me out sometimesBecause the spirits, we ain't really rappin'
We just letting our dead homies tell stories for usDamn
I wanted to read one last thing to you
It's actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world
It says"The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city
While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar
But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city
The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts
He's trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas start to take roots
Such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
The result?
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations
That the caterpillar never considered, ending the eternal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
They are one and the same"What's your perspective on that?
Pac, Pac, Pac 
Starin' at Marilyn Monroe's silhouette while smokin' my first cigarette
Listenin' to Marvin ask his father about his death

Dead bodies in my dreams, Bob Marley on my couch
Pass me the blunt, he was smokin' when he died
You really think Elvis Presley committed suicide?

It's either kill or you be killed
Ten pints of blood per human, ain't no refills
One thing about us humans, nigga, we kill
Turkeys, chickens, pigs, each other, fuck us, we will
Take a life, lethal injection or free will
Tookie got murdered by the pigs, fuck did he kill?
That ain't none of my business, though

He died slow in his music, you ain't really listen
Now his daughter gettin' slapped by his sister
And that's probably gon' kill they mama
So I'm sorry Ms. Jackson, I'm sorry Ms. Houston, sissy
Might shed a tear but ain't no sissy
'Cause Whitney's still with me
And her death kinda hurt a nigga
So let's get back to talkin' 'bout murder, nigga
John Lennon got shot in the back
And Paul McCartney couldn't do shit 'bout that
'Cause it was murder, nigga
Listen, this ain't about you and me

Twelve years of school and it ain't in one damn book
Lee Harvey Oswald 'bout to serve a sentence
From the crowd comes a revolver
That's murder, niggaMurder

The Game told you what the play was
So it don't matter what you say, cuz
Say Blood, these niggas livin' what they die by
You out here playin' while these niggas doin' drive-bys
If murder was the case that they gave Snoop
Then how the fuck you thinking they gon' save you?
Them niggas played you
You doin' stand up
You a comedian there, boy, get your hands up
Don't turn this to a 1-8-7
I have you leanin' on the stairway to Heaven
Spittin' blood, these are tales from the hood
Suicide sound quicker, but a murder sounds good
Wish a motherfucker would try to play me like a toy
You get a bullet in your motherfuckin' head, homeboy
The people sayin' that a drug overdose killed Hendrix
They bullshitted, tt was murder
Or a plane crash killed Otis Redding
That's how they said it, but it was murder
The cops kill us at alarming rates
They point they guns at the ones they hate
If Bin Laden brought the World Trade down
Then how the fuck did he die just now?
Murder, murderMurder
Murder kill kill
They killin' motherfuckers still
And I'm just tellin' y'all the real
Nigga, murder murder murder
Nigga, kill kill kill
For realMurder
Gunfire, death is so quiet, ask why, tell 'em it's
Murder
The sun rise then hide by grey skies, that cry sounds like
Murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder 
As my mind drift anExplaind then split
Like the middle of a spliff, I begin to catapult off
The cliff of the unknown
I got a feeling in my funny bone that we're not the same
Just antonyms of another age
My soul flock with the carefree
Words of the wise, I spoke a hundred times like a gold E
Haha LMFAO
I hate y'all but I spread love like mayo
Then spread slugs
My brain matter is a brain fatter
See, my vision on my vision will stare at ya
This is the future if I say so, you copping fitted caps
I'm about to go and cop a halo
The God of rap and I mean it, and I play football with Mars
And marbles with Pluto and Venus
Witness the genius, I enter rap with the inner-city feelings
That enters your system like a computer hack
Then give you dap 
 
I can see the darkness in me and its quite amazing
Life and death is no mystery and I wanna taste it
Step inside of my mind and you'll find
Curiosity, animosity, high philosophy like the prophesied meditation
Reminisce on my wonder years and I wonder yah
Sentiments of my words ain't been so sincere
The sentiment of my nerves that I just persevere
The big thought of fallin' off disappeared to my fate
They say that Heaven's real
Analyze my demise, I say I'm super anxious
Recognize I deprive this fear and then embrace it
Vandalizing these walls only if they could talk
Conversations don't contemplate to my dark thoughts
Lookin' down on my soul now
Tell me I'm in control now
Tell me I can live long and I can live wrong and I can live right
And I can sing songs and I can unite with you that I love, you that I like
Look at my life and tell me I fight
This that final destination, this that find some information
This that find some inspiration, this that crack, the instillation
This that consciousness sharpening and fist pump and that bomb detonation
Please don't bomb my nation, embalming fluid waiting
I got mind control when I'm here, you gon' hate me when I'm gone
Ain't no blood pumpin' no fear, I got hope inside of my bones
This that life beyond your own life, this say this go for mankind
This that outer-body experience, no coincidence you been died
You are deadSay you will never ever catch me, no, no, no 
I love the way you, put it on your eyes
The roses on your face, light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind
No makeup today (day, day, day, day)
No makeup today (day, day, day, day) today
No makeup today (day, day, day, day)
No makeup today (day, day, day, day)
And girl that's fine but I wanna know do you mindI know she bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful, and how long it took
For you to put it on, it was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a Mac book
Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
I stand behind her and try to figure her vision
Of prettiness, the wittiness, of colors on her skin tone
Her complexion in a direction I've outgrown
Damn girl, why so much?
You bout to blow your cover when you cover up
Don't you know your imperfections
Is a wonderful blessing
From heaven, is where you got it from
I love your smile, you can do it without style
From your lips, all the way to your eyebrows
It's the beauty in her but when the makeup occur
I don't see it, all I see is a blurI love the way you, put it on your eyes
The roses on your face, light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind
No makeup today (day, day, day, day)
No makeup today (day, day, day, day) today
No makeup today (day, day, day, day)
No makeup today (day, day, day, day)
And girl that's fine but I wanna know do you mind (mind, mind, mind, mind)I know she bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful and how long it took
For you to put it on it was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a Mac book
(Concentrating on the way my) eyeliner thickens
(He stand behind me and try to) figure her vision
(Of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on my skin tone)
(My complexion in a direction) I've outgrown
(I feel like it's not enough)
(I can never put on too much makeup)
(Yeah I know) your imperfections
(I be constantly stressing, from him is where I get it from)
(They tell me I need to) smile
(At least once in a while)
(I hate my lips, my nose, my) eyebrows
(It's the beauty in me)
(But what he don't see, is that I had a black...)
To be continued elevenLadies and gentlemen
And you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
You ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
You ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
You ain't gotta get drunk to have fun (have fun)I love the way you, put it on your eyes
The roses on your face, light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind
No makeup today (day, day, day, day)
No makeup today (day, day, day, day) today
No makeup today (day, day, day, day)
No makeup today (day, day, day, day)
And girl that's fine but I wanna know do you mind (mind, mind, mind, mind) 
We on?
Aight
One, two, three, go!Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name and your song, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be hereEverywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin' how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I amI'm so high,, I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright, I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing betterA fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted to the earth
'Cause the people that hurt can't understand it
You speakin' outlandish, I'm gonna show you how to make it all work
Another planet, it's a short term role for me
A record sold for me, it's just mo for me
And you're here for you too here, Kendrick, persevere
Defenses, I yet feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin' off, I ain't takin' off these pistons
I'm takin' off on the enemies, your distance
Came across me, how much it'd cost me to get you out my business?
I said a planet is a short term goal, no sky is the limit
I'm past that, now pass that
A word not one but four times two plus yoursI see myself performing at
Sold out shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammy's, winning five awards
See myself on big billboards
Climbing round the world would endorse me deals
Can't imagine how it feels
That's why I'm smiling every day
'Cause my dream ain't far awayI'm so high, I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright, I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing betterYou're looking at me and tell me I'm blessed
Calculating my steps, my heart, my breath
Breath lungs of a victory and vividly you see me when I'm at my best, my worse
This verse is dedicated to the days that I slept with the curse
Research my paid dues, I'm reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
I'm a king on a prowl and I see mama smile
And the vow I'm a take that I'll never break
You can break bread with me now, we can all take a bow
On the edge of the pedestal and scream out loud
That we made it off the avenue, I walk then down, in the darkness
I often sit back and get lost in the rap that I wrote
When you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talkin' to you, I was walkin' it through
Heavy ghetto, tail of success, hello, we hereAnd I'm so happy I cry
'Cause I can't believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it's so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I could wake up
From this fantasy
When you pray so hard
And you've come so far
And you know, that is the time for you to lift your bar
And I'm gonna do it
Watch meI'm so high, I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright, I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing betterI'm so high, I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
I'm so bright, I light the night
And it feels so right ain't nothing better 
We hurt people that love us
Love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us
Love people
I'm inspired
So get inspired
And so he saidWhy you gotta be so kind hearted
Why you couldn't be a con artist
Why you couldn't, why you couldn't be mischievous
Or just a lil devious the moment that we first started
Why you never ask for nothing, just a lil time
Why you let me use yours 'cause I don't got mines
Why you always lift me up, when I'm completely giving up
Or when niggas holla what's up, you give a dry response
Why you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it
Why you always buy me something when you going shopping
Why you tell me that you love me
Why you always thinking of me when my company rather than going club hopping
Why you treatin' my momma like she your momma too
Why you making promises that you'll forever do
Whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family
These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you
SometimesWe hurt people that love us
Love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us
Love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us
Love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us
Love people that hurt us
Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common, it ain't fair
But where do we seem to fall
Where do we seem to fall
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there
And so she said
Why you gotta be so mean to me
Why you don't know what you mean to me
Why you always playing games
Why I feel like you ashamed
Out in public curse me out and make a scenery
Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me
My text messages poppin up saying "Hi Daddy"
Why you treat me like I'm nothing
Why you always outta function
I be wanting to go out but you don't ever ask me
Why you slip and say her name when we having sex
Why you always assuming that I still love my ex
Every time we get into it I'm the one that's feeling stupid
You don't need me, you gon' leave me
That's ya favorite threat
Why you never know how it feel to be lonely
Why I feel I'm the last option after ya homies
Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go
Even though you get violent and put your hands on me
SometimesWe hurt people that love us
Love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us
Love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us
Love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us
Love people that hurt us
Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common, it ain't fair
But where do we seem to fall
Where do we seem to fall
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there 
 
Nod if you want to be high with the enemy
It's a test of your stamina, do your best
Nod if you want to make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby, smoke it up 'til we're flyin'Tell my mama it's bad karma, I just killed a man
Tell your auntie he got to pardon me if I hide my hand
Fuck what you heard, this shit is revolutionary
Fuck what you heard, this is the last illusion, bury
Me with the nerve and ninety-five marksmen
So I can shoot this game until my trigger finger jam
I see red flag, I see blue flag
I pick a color, then make sure I don't give you a pass
You call it gang violence, you call it livin' mad
I called it life, but now I'm like, 'I fuckin' hate it bad'
And so we holler, 'Fuck what you heard
See, we been down for too long
Fuck what you heard, we been tired of doin' wrong
If you got the nerve to man up and kill a man
Then man up double time and shake that adversary's hand, bangNod if you want to be high with the enemy
It's a test of your stamina, do your best
Nod if you want to make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby, smoke it up 'til we're flyin'Um, this for the hatred in you
This is for that place of darkness they have placed into you
This is for the early coffins of those discriminated
Or racially profiled, I can look you in the eye
And make a vow that I'll never make another assumption
That you'll never be nothin' to me, he fin' if you did the opposite
I'll still run with pleasure
Doin' you the favour of cuttin' through the evil
Kendrick Lamar like God-lover of all people, bangPrepare, I descend from the East, my name is Lady Gaga
We party nauseous cause, ma
Prepare, I descend from the West, my name is Kendrick Lamar
We party nauseous cause, maNod if you want to be high with the enemy
It's a test of your stamina, do your best
Nod if you want to make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby, smoke it up 'til we're flyin' 
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
In due time I'm the modern day Albert Einstein
I'm prime time like Deion
And the rest of y'all is peons
I pee on the best
Whoever you are you can step
Like a prosthetic leg
I see monsters in my head
That's why I rap with such aggression
I tear down studio sessions
Rappers scared, they walk in the booth
With a bible and a reverend
I use my mouth as a weapon
Bullets rip through your mid section
Rat tat a tat tat tat rata tat tat tat
I'm a Comptown, nigga get a casket
Go against me, that'll lead to my advantage
Because I've got to eat
And for real I'm feeling kind of famished
Hotter than the earth core, don't show me where no fan is
Show me where your fans is so they can see the real
I'm sick and electrifying, that's double ill
Me feel like me will be a legend like Will was a legend
But I'm not an actor, put that in my will
Gimme a second uncut coke lyrics what I'm stressing
She want the raw so I fed her lines like Kevin
Tell 'em I'm a werewolf, behold the 5 6 bigfoot
Lear jet overlook the country like Garth Brooks
Lyrics on point, plus I got the right hooks
Like Tommy Hearns, punchlines burn
I'm not concerned about the SoundScan
Cause most of y'all is drowning
A lifeguard that's lounging
Meaning I don't worry about none of you rappers
I'm way more live
That's evil backwards
Now with that great word play
I tend to let my words play
Like children on a Saturday
It's sad to say you're not up to par
And I don't play with mini golf and sharks
Jump inside the pool of sharks, we're biting off your head, your heart, your legs, arms
Bled like Jay Rock or Big Y
And make sure you wear a vest
Because they my family ties
Suit up
You got a three piece? I got a three piece
A MAC-11, a 9 mili, and a DE
He backpedaling like a DB
I'm such a Martian
Call me ET
Always behind it like I own the TP
I shit, fart, pee pee
On anybody track
Walk in the booth and drink down a fifth of Ex-Lax
Wassup
Now phone home
My nigga Punchline is on, wipe 'em down[Verse 2: Punch]
Your boy carry that flame I am a arsonist
I spit arsenic at you niggas cartilage
Ill wip, drive by, niggas carsick
20 on the charm
VVS studded flawless
Try and reach we specialize in garbage
Taking out the trash put you underneath the tar pits
How many times I gotta tell y'all niggas the big fish in the small pond
I wail on niggas I'm vicious
No, I'm serious
Skip the birth canal and climb straight Cesarean
You niggas ain't listening
I'm not from 'round these parts
I'm nonexistent
Hit you with brake light
Leave you missing 
 
Smoke good, eat good, live goodI used to want to see the penitentiary
Way after elementary
Thought it was cool to look the judge
In the face when he sentenced me
Since my uncles was institutionalized
My intuition has said I was suited for family ties
My mama is stressing, my daddy tired
I need me a weapon, these niggas ride
Every minute, hour and second, ministers tried
To save me, how I'm gonna listen
When I don't even hear God?
Heaven or Hell, base it all on my instincts
My hands dirty, you worried bout mud in your sink
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
The same nigga that killed with ya, squealed with ya
I deal with ya like my son
Stare at the sun and you'll be lookin'
In my eyes homie stand for something
Or fall for anything, and you working
With two left feet at the skating rink
But anyway, this for my niggas
Uncles, 23 hours sending me pictures
I want you to know that I'm so determined
To blow, that you hear the music
I wrote, hope it get you off Death Row
You came home to a pocket full of stones
A Metro PC phone, then you went back in
So when I touch the pen, the Pen is in
My view, I'mma get it right, just so youSmoke good, eat good, live goodAnd I do this for the city
Got some Hennessey and my real
Niggas with me
Fuck the police, they gonna have
To come and get me
If it feel good to you
Holler if you hear meYou like to mistake a street nigga for a real nigga
That same nigga that kill with ya, will squeal with ya
I'd like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya
Be on my last dollar and split the bill with ya
I'm 23 with morals and plans of living cordial
Not rich, but wealthy
There's nothing you can tell me
My killings are not remorseful
The city got my back, and for that, I give them my torso
You think about it, and don't call me lyrical
Cause really I'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
I know some rappers using big words
To make their similes curve
My simplest shit be more pivotal
I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
Worry some individuals that live life critical
So won't you bare witness while I bare feet
So you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
But anyway, this for my pops
On his lunch break, eating in the parking lot
On 'Wanna Be Heard,' probably thought he worked my nerves
But really he was stressing me, getting what I deserved
Somebody said my name on the radio
He ain't know I was ready for
The world that minute
So the next time he roll up
And drop grams in it, he'll probably be
Out of work, laid back, while heSmoke good, eat good, live goodAnd I do this for the city
Got some Hennessey and my real
Niggas with me
Fuck the police, they gonna have
To come and get me
If it feel good to you
Holler if you hear meChurch is definitely on the move and now we
Took it up to the cathedral cause the ism is enormous
You know what I'm talkin' about?
We out here rotating under the five p's, proper
Preparation prevents poor performance
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Doin' my thing, cause I'm rotatin' when my
Speakers thumpin' from the windy city streets
All the way out here to the streets of Compton
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Church is definitely on the move and we gonna
Continue to hustle and grow and develop by
Fire, as I rotate with my true player partner
By the name of Kendrick Lamar
You know what I'm talkin' about?
This is the ism this is the vision
You know what I'm talkin' about?
You gotta get up off your ass and get it, man
That's the only way your pockets gonna expand, I
Tell you everyday, you know what I'm talkin' about
Apply yourself to supply your wealth, only
Limitations you'll ever have are those you
Place upon yourself church is definitely on
The move, you know what I'm talkin' about
Exercise your ism and don't depend on no one
Else, cathedral, church, ism 
Every second, every minute, man I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go!I recognize your fragrance (hol' up!)
You ain't never gotta say shit (woo!)
And I know your taste is
A little bit (mmm) high maintenance (ooh)
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you
When you're in the mood for empathy, theres blood in my pen
Better yet where your friends and them?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and
Y'all curled in that little bitty Range I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation, rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
'less I write it down for real, P.SYou can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a songYou can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a songI really hope you play this
'Cause ol' girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taken
Clearly a lot for me to take in
It don't make sense
Young East African Girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was trying to put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's all right here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life but God damn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress (ooh!)
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less
And we would talk more
And they say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real
P.SYou can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a songEvery time I write these words they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve, every letter is true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you looking in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you looking for a maybe
Call me crazy, We can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common
And what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering
Sex drive when you swerve, I want that interference
It's coherent, I can hear it, mmhmm
That's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, mmhmm
Breathe slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly
And right before you go blind
P.SYou can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song 
Every second, every minute, man I swear that she can get it

Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart
You love 'em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in the perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics hoping I make amend
I understand I ain't perfect
I probably won't come around
This time, I might put you down
Last time, I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I'm willing to give up a leg and arm and show empathy from
Pity parties and functions and you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecureIt wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I careMaybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't thereNow, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December, but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point, nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, worldIt wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I careMaybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there 
Love's gonna get you killed
But pride's gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me andIt wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there

I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really realI promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flippin' down the green hill
You living in a world that come with plan B
'Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red-bottom and gold they say queen
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love french tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourselfI do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really realI promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics? turn stale
Where they mow that's green
I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with Plan B
Cause Plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks you, you still say you're lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women
You love keepin' control
Of everything you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love runnin', duckin' police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really realThe reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes can't you tell
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come for free
And plan C just an excuse like because
Or the word "but", but what if I got love
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse cause your the homie they packed
Burning like a stove top, they love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much
I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love
Should I hate living my life inside the club
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm season
Should I hate them for telling me ball out
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hatin' all money, power, respect in my will
I'm hatin' the fact that none of that shit make me realI do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really realSing my song, it's all for you 
[Verse 1]
You never knew a plug, plug, plug, a plug like this
Sophisticated gangsta, watch me thug like this
Snatch your, uh, in a club like this
Seven zeros, need my pub like this
Stuck in a rock in a hard place
I am thinkin' I won't bump y'all up, well, I am
I got to get my thing off
My style come from Devin the Dude, Kurupt, 2
And James Brown with his fist crossed
I fluctuate the vocals like Prince Rogers
Whoever thought a billionaire come out of Compton?
Multiply simple logic, it's rules you can follow
If Dre ain't motivation, I don't know who is
Gift and a curse, maybe them shoes is too big
Or maybe I'm too pessimistic to know I'm gifted
Chasin' hood rat brownie points and bullshittin'
I dropped the four on 'em, scrapin', hopped a four on 'em
Grab my dick and pour on 'em
Yeah, homie, I'm still talkin' that whoop-de-whoop
Hoppin' out on my enemies, I know who to shoot
Back when my homies where I need to be
Such a familiar sceneries, I smell the gun smoke
I watched a homie watch his son smoke
I seen the sun set on my set
I seen one 'Ru and one Loc, one slip and one played him close
Everythin' subject to change
Nowadays, the Compton (?) kill each other
Faster than an opposite color
Homies whack out everythin', you're dead, homie
It's your mother, your uncle and brother
If God was a Loc, he'd probably had one comin'
Damn, that's fucked up, I guess it is
When you can't trust not a soul inside these streets
I made a video out there in Copenhagen, so the homies can see
To let 'em know it's more than just Pamela Lee
They said, "Good looking"
Paused the video the moment his phone ring
That fast dollar was his only problem
No matter how many times I showed him the Eiffel Tower
The block was home and Africa was too far for power
Then I knew[Bridge]
And you don't and you don't and you don't
And you don't and you don't and you don't
And you don't and you don't and you don't
And you don't and you don't stop[Verse 2]
This feelin' is unmatched
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black Pendleton ball cap
Windows shatter, same synonym fall back
Been in it before Internet had impacts
My innocence limited, the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer, but I did in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin', scratchin' diligent sentences backwards
Visitin' freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now I can visit a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sittin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision
Kendrick is master and mastered it
Isn't it lovely how menace has turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction, runnin' pure magic
Thank God for rap, I will say it got me a plaque
But what's better than that? I know everything
I know everything, I know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and beheld
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything, I know Compton
I know street shit, I know shit that's conscience, I know everything
I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit, that isn't meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's hungry
I know everything, the highs to lows to groupies and junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision
You know, they know that from Compton School District
I give it to the kids, don't gossip 'bout how it was distributed
I, I, I know how people work, I know the price of life
I know how much it's worth, I know what I know and I know it well
Not to ever forget until I realized I didn't know shit
Big Boy, what's up?[Bridge]
And you don't and you don't and you don't
And you don't and you don't and you don't
And you don't and you don't and you don't
And you don't and you don't stop[Verse 3]
I don't give a buck about no politics in rap
My little homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back
So I got to go hard every time I jump on wax
Bump what they talking 'bout, this here is where it's at
Look, I came in this game, I stuck my fangs in this game
I wore no chain in this game, my hood, my name in this game
Now I double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
I'm stickin' to the scripts like, "Yeah, 'em Benjamins can cuddle up"
I skip, hop, I drip-drop, I flip-flop with them white tube socks
It go sherm sticks, watch me burn this
That's what the chronic smell like when them chemicals mix
Fifty-homie salute, I'm out to Compton Zoo with the extras
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressers
Rip Ridaz, (?), Mexicans that eff with me
Nobody can eff with me, tell y'all to eff with me
Jumpin' out the Caddy, uh, just got my (?)
The little homies called
They said, "The enemies done cliqued up"
Oh, yeah? Punto want to squabble with me, vatio?
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Homie's name on paper, you snitched all summer
The streets don't fail me now, they want to put the game in town
From Compton to Congress, it's set trippin' all around
Ain't nothin' new but a flow of new DemoCrips and ReBloodlicans
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin'?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
Tell me they profit to fuck with you
Nobody can fuck with you, Obama said, "What it do?"[Bridge]
Can I get one more?[Verse 4]
Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin'
Motherfuck if they did, then a nigga'd be platinum
Y'all priorities bullshit, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don't ask about no politician at award shows
No, don't ask about my, uh, no, don't ask about my foes
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
"K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora's box"
I box 'em all in, buyin' land stock 
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really realI promise that I know you very well

Alright, here we go, third take, real quick AliGot me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, now just imagine the magic
I light to asses, don't ask for your favorite rapper(He dead) Yessir (Amen) Chuuch
(He dead) I killed him (Amen) BitchAnd this is rigamortis and it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded and I'm Morpheus, the Matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme if you the shit then I decline
I climax where you begin and then I end on Cloud 9
And that's important when you morph into a angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply and tell me
That you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
And I'mma be here for a while just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you could fight, we always making them duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI just might investigate this fucking parasite(He dead, amen) That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity, this is studio felony
Ferragami so many and cool enough for the 70's
Nigga, payback's a bitch and bitch you been living in debt with me
That I more than especially, leave a call on his mother voicemail
To say that he rest in peace, bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling, that's irrelevant rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q, it's just me Jay Rock, Soul and Q
So the system ain't barbeque, ain't nothing else you can do(He dead) Yup-yup (Amen) I killed him

I'm Marilyn Manson don't ask for your favorite rapper
I rapped him and made him Casper, I captured the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya, I pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, won't you send us to bible study faster
Your hypocrite-esque reaction a blasphemy
I assassin my casualty and it's casually done and tell 'em my salary come
A lump sum of hundreds don't talk to be 'bout no money
The sun is under my feet and I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek and I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see any assistance, everybody done see
Some persistence, recognize I be really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition, breaking up the streets, better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention, how the far you see, putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitchin', getting mad at me, recognize Kendrick in the battery
And I'm charged up and the catastrophe is charged up and the audacity
And y'all fucks, never could hassle me and y'all luck, just ran out you'll see(He dead) Yup-yup (Amen) I know

Pull Up, I'm parking my Caddy
That's when I fuck it up badly
Frankly, I'm happy to tell niggas
"Have manners 'front the daddy"
I carry the Anthony Mackie
And put holes in you badly
Fuck sending you off in a hearse
I'll send you off in a taxi
Have you bloody leaky looking like you tampon or maxi
Retaliation talk: shut the fuck up nigga
Exactly nasty the classy the flashiest how I'm on it
Don't ask me no kind of questions and mention
I'll leave your face in a pantry
And gladly lump up your shit and bumpin your face up like acne
Break your teeth, replace them with veneers bigger than Lil Scrappy
Feeling like growing my dread again
Letting my shit get nappy
Throw me on a New York fitted
While reppin' like I'm a Yankee
If they wanna front then I hit em and I tap em
Eat a nigga's food like its a scampi
When it come to bitch niggas, I'm a little bit a racist
Governor Pataki
Papi, you're the master, auntie
Pops was a little bit manly, fuck all that aiming
I'mma hit him in the front, hit him in the back
So substanc-y
Then I gotta Bit-a-bit-a-bit-a-bit-a-beat a nigga leave him in the alley
You don't really wanna know how you niggas always be making me aggie
Organs in your drawers now you wearing your pants saggy
Haggling niggas with scriptures, spittin, you should be happy
Gradually when I hit you I split you and leave you sadly in a
Situation lay you out flatter than chicken patties
It's the God, you hear me talking whenever you hear the raspy
And when it comes to murkin' something you should never put past me![Hook]

We're far from good
Not good from far
90 miles per hour down Compton Boulevard
With the top down, screaming we don't give a fuck
Drink my 40 ounce of freedom while I roll my blunt
Cause the kids just aint alrightOh shit nigga

Nigga this shit, nigga this sound like 30 keys under the compton court building
Hope the dogs don't smell itWelcome to vigilante

Peeling off like a? examine my orchestra
Granny said when I'm old enough
I'll be sure to be all I can be
You niggas Marcus Camby, washed up
Pussy fix ya panties
I'm Mr. Marcus, you gettin' fucked, ugh
You ain't heard nothing harder since Daddy Kane
Take it vain, Vicodins couldn't ease the pain
Lightening bolts hit ya body, you thought it rained
Not a cloud in sight, just the shit that I write strong enough
To stand in front of a traveling freight train
Are you trained, to go against Dracula
Dragging the record industry by my fangs
AK clips, money clips and gold chains
You walk around with a P90 like it's the 90's
Bullet to your temple your homocide'll remind meThem Compton crip niggas aint nothing to fuck with
Bompton Piru's aint nothing to fuck with

Squad cars, neighborhood wars and stolen monsters

Up and down, get 64 better know how to drive it
I'm driving on E with no license or registration
Heart racin' racing past johnny because he's racist
1987, the children of Ronald Reagan raped the leaves off your front porch
With a machine blow torch
He blowing on sess, hoping to ease the stress
He copping some blow hoping that it can stretch
New born massacre, hoppin' out the passenger
With calendars cause your date coming
Run 'em down them he gun em down
I'm hoping that you fast enough

(Preferably in a residential...)Life's a bitch, life's a bitch
But I'ma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
I'ma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
I'ma keep the pussy wet
I'ma keep the pussy wet
My dick hard, her pussy wet[Kendrick Lamar - Verse 1]
And I'm born with my dick in the earth, you can tell me how much am I worth
I'ma die with my heart on my sleeve, many die on their hands and their knees
And I'm takin' whatever I need, and I'm rapin' the government fees
And you're wastin' your time, and I'm speakin' my mind on whatever I think
And I think that I'm Richard Pryor with priors of 32 fiends
And that means that I here fly higher, tell me why are you starin' at me?
Matta fact, man, your eyes is wired, you inspired by Kendrick the king
Maybe it's 'cause I'm livin' my dream, man, I sing what I'm livin' about
And the words that come out of my mouth, they requires a random routine
Of being organic granite, then my access is granted
To represent the shit that I conceive, and I guarantee that I'ma bring
My mind, body, soul and I sold all these records off bein' myself
And I wish you can do the same thing, man, it's easier than a stripper
Or tyin' a baby shoestring, you stringing along
And really why you writing a song? Your passion for music is never in sync
No secret societies guided me to the world of unseen
And they tell me life is a bitch, who gives a shit? You can believeI'ma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
I'ma keep the pussy wet (Yep)
My-my dick hard, her pussy wet
I'ma keep the pussy wet (Yep)(Hi, ho!) I came
(Bye, ho!) I went (We-we-went-went)
(Hi, ho!) I ca-came
(Bye, ho!) I went
(Hi, ho!) I came
(Bye, ho!) I went
(Bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch-bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch)[Kendrick Lamar - Verse 2]
And I see that you envy of me, enemy ghosts don't prosper
Better yet, they do die eventually, if I'm at the event you will leave
'Cause you know and I know that I go ham even if Muslims is seen
In my rearview I'm near you, but I don't hear you, can you hear this breathe?
Wit' an oxygen mask, and the masses keep sayin' I'm speakin' for them
And if you can imagine my madness, then you can see where I've been
And the places the Louis has been, and I swear I been doin' this when
You was in pajamas, watchin' B-B-Barney a-and Friends
And you couldn't harm me even with ten, weapons of your choice ridin' in
Army tanks, you shot blanks, and I shot back, make your duplex bend
What the fuck you think? If I don't think, then I'm right back where the city sin
What the fuck you drink? Thinkin' I can't write these raps in the Lions' Den
When I hear that you lyin', then? It's murder, she wrote, ain't no hope
You go downhill, man, where's your slope? Get thrown downhill tied to a rope
Told the world to put intervals, man, I swear this the Hannibal
And they tell me that life is a bitch, who gives a shit when you know?[Hook]And I see that you envy of me-me-me-me-me
Don't prosper, better yet, they do die eventually-ly-ly
'Cause you know and I know that I go ham even if Muslims is seen
In my rearview I'm near you...(Hi, ho!)

(Intro)
Yeah, Kendrick Lamar. This is for the town nigga!(Verse 1)
Me I'm from the hub city Yeah that compton court building
Caught a murder when his homie died Judge Caught Feelings
Im on Rosecrans chilling right inside best outlest
Five dollar Little Caesar Momma shopped at Food for less
Elementary McNair say whats up to Vanguard
Centennial high, had me swimming with a pool of sharks
Me I'm just a good kid trying to keep it neutral
But Im well aware that a square can get shot too
Most Crip and some Piru thats just how the game go
Hood on every corner stop for gas and get your brains blown
Bitches with fat asses burning in the stashes
Murders in July call that summer time madness
Rest in peace 4bent rest in peace moss-berg
Swear to god when I make it big yo voice will be heard
Me Im just a good kid trying to keep it positive
Though I know its chaos forever my heart will live in...(Chorus)
Compton, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in Compton
These streets will make you or break you
Expire or inspire you
Let's hear it for Compton, Compton, Compton(Verse 2)
Take you back to Y.E.T it was just divining me
Earl had got disciplined for not catching a fade that week
Shit had made him stronger though, yeah those were the good old days
Eating Tam's burger while my Juvenile CD had played
21 outside maybe sideline pop
Yellow tape on sidewalk damn somebody got popped
Hoping that I live a lot, I don't want to die young
Please don't come shoot up my party, I just want to have fun
Sheriffs in my rear view, mother fuck the police
Pull me over just to plant an 8 ball on me
Fuck it though I'm out here, I've always been out here
Since the Compton swap meet, black and red LA gears
Pac was on Rosecrans nigga I was right there
Cali Love video he said whattup I said yeah
Free my nigga J-Dub and both of the J-Mans
Eazy paved the way, Lil Eazy bout to get it in for..(Chorus)(Verse 3)
I'm talking bout Westside Piru, N.H.P., Campanella, Carver Park
Front Hood, Nutty Blocc, Lantana, 151, Park Village
Cedar Block, Santana
Burgundy and Blue bandanas
Peace! Peace!
Fruit Town, Kelly Park, Southside, Elm Street
Poccet Hood, ATF, MOB, LPP, 135, VTP
Atlantic Drive, Limehood, NHC, PBC
Peace! Peace!
Tragniew, Compton Raymonds, Tree-Top, Mona Park, T Flats, 7 Os, 155
Compton Swamps, Holly hood, T Zones
All a nigga really want for us to keep
Peace! Peace!
But shit that a take some time and more time
But I'm pushing to get us there in no time
Me, I'm just a good kid hoping I can spread love
Word to the county building forever I do it for...(Chorus)(Outro)
[My nigga Hootie told me to keep it Compton, keep it Compton yeah
E-S-T 1987, Dominguez Hospital that bitch was on Bullis Road] 
Love's gonna get you killed
But pride's gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me andIt wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I careHell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldy possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart
You love 'em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in the perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics hoping I make amend
I understand I ain't perfect
I probably won't come around
This time, I might put you down
Last time, I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I'm willing to give up a leg and arm and show empathy from
Pity parties and functions and you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecureIt wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I careMaybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't thereNow, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December, but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point, nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, worldIt wasn't all to share, but there
In another life, I surely was there
It wasn't all to share, but there
I care, I careMaybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there

Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference between black artists and wack artistsIf I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
(It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri)
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element 
I got, I got, I got, I got
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition, flow, inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this
Immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this
Was Yeshua's new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got
Realness, I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome, heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you
This is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids
And I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier's DNA
Born inside the beast
My expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to
Antisocial, extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And that's a riff, gonna plead this case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet sayI got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
(This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage
To young African Americans than racism in recent years)
I live a better, fuck your life
(5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the makin' of marriagesTell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you're in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows, I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murderâthese are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murderâour DNA 
K.Dot, you know that he's hot
I can do rhythm, hip hop, I can do pop
We talking 'bout the black, we talking 'bout the brown
We talk 'bout the white, it don't care who you around
It's all about the positivity when you with energy
If you knew me, then you know that God had witnessed me

I will ask that Jesus will come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus name, AmenI met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians
Push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
"Hello my name is Kendrick"
She said "No, you're handsome"
Whispered in my ear, disappeared then found her dancing
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearing shades now (cool)
"Where you stay?"
She said "Down the street from Dominguez High"
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
"Well is it Compton?"
"No," she replied and quickly start batting her eyes and
I strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen, with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful
"What you trying to get into?"
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer and wellThe summer had passed and now I'm liking her
Conversation we having probably enticing her
Who could imagine, maybe my actions would end up wifing her
Love or lust, regardless we'll fuck cause the trife in us
It's deep rooted, the music of being young and dumb
Its never muted, in fact it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius' reputable
Family history of gang banging did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from getting a nut
I wanna come over, what's up?
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off
I'm trying to get off
I was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of being thirsty
Probably could hurt me, but fuck it I got some heart
Grab my momma's keys, hopped in the car, then oh boySo now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passing Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope cause my pockets broke as a promise man
I'm thinking bout that sex, thinking bout her thighs
Or maybe kissing on her neck, or maybe what positions next
Sent a picture of her titties blowing up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional porn star when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hoping to get her loose like an Uncle Luke Anthem
I'm two blocks away, two hundred and fifty feet
And six steps from where she stay, she waving me 'cross the street
I pulled up a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang 
Lord God
I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that you raised him from the dead
I will ask that Jesus will come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth

[J. Cole]
Life make a n-gga wanna yell out,
Change for the fame, how n-ggas turn sell out,
Too old for my mama crib I'm tryin to get the hell out,
Stayin out these cells but we working on that bail out,
Help out.. please, it sure is hard livin with out cheese,
Aint shit in my pocket only these house keys,
They pray for a n-gga but yet they doubt me
That's why I'm out getting higher than bel-vees,
But no I wont jump, being broke is childish you know I'm grown up
My money runnin' late tho so boy I wont front,
When my paper finally make it you should know I'm gonna stunt
Soo, hard[Chorus]
My God, my life is such ?
Can't save me tonight cause times is hard now
I know you tell me don't let my guard down
I gotta get it my n-gga
Never believe what they say
Man, I gotta get paid
?
Yo I'ma shock the World
I'ma shock the World[Kendrick Lamar]
Stare inside of the soul of Kendrick
While I stare inside the solar... system
Hopin' I soak up enough game to play 3 systems with one controller and remain sane and remain unsober
Was Closer To My Dreams but reality actually told me hold up
No money in my jeans and my salary said "you owe us"
Can't pay them taxes, laid on that matress and feel colder than a polar bear
But this bear was in California
So I felt out a pocket and a piece of lint fell out my pocket
A broke opportunist all in my optics
You could see it even when I'm Sleep
My screw's loose, I hate when loose change fall in them seats
Because I need every dime like Magic Johnson or Hugh Hefner living in his prime
Prime example of youngin' on his grind
This the life of a Compton n-gga
I know the vanities of the World like the promise n-ggas
That's why we crooked in yo bushes where you find us n-gga You better scramble before you fold like an omelet n-gga
This ain't insomnic n-gga and that means I don't need Busters to front on me
A Bible in my pocket I'm walkin' like it's a gun on me
So when I catch a Fed they know to put more than one on me
Fear No Evil, I can still see Regals pullin' up
N-ggas tuck like a baby in fetal. . . Position
If you listen you can hear the City needs you
That's what my mind said
But my big head is tellin' me that I'm a Black Beetle
Until my number is called and someone yell Bingo
A shadow in the Dark, Park The Coupe
Then Re-Coop with the homeless in the park, Kendrick Lamar 
When the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about meI said when the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about meI woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hoping that I can borrow a piece of mind
I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright
And a fight he tried to put up, but the type
Of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands
My plans rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering, "Get em"
I got em, and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality that told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover
A passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a young'n
In pajamas and Dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child
I'm proud and well devoted
This piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'mma push it, wherever whenever
And I love you cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop I hope --When the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about meYou wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it section .80, the message resemble Brenda's Got a Baby
Whats crazy was, I was hearin about it
But doubted your ignorance, how could you ever
Just put her on blast and shit
Judging her past and shit
Well it's completely my future
A nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
And I'mma need that 40 dollars even if I gotta
Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys
Matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get em back
To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman, or better yet a leader
You need her to learn something, then you probably need to beat her
That's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted
But fuck that "Sorry for your loss" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait
Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away
I know my fate, and I'm on the grind for this cake
I'mma get or die trying, I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
You lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me nigga where the fuck is u going nigga, this bullshit...When the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about meSometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself
Am I really scared of passing away
If it's today I hope I hear a
Cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
Rake in the cent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon
And if I'm doomed, may the wound
Help my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm sure not why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about
Cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe cause I'm dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the scheme of, wondering when I'mma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that put me
In a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like "it need to be told
Cursing the life of 20 generations after her" so
Exactly would have happened if I hadn't continued rappin
Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
Fives, I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fighting for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Now am I worth it?
Did I put enough work in?When the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about mePromise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about meTired of running
Tired of hunting
My own kind
But retiring nothing
Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirstDope on the corner
Look at the coroner
Daughter is dead
Mother is mourning her
Strayed bullets
AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently but they couldn't
Bring her back
Who got the footage?
Channel 9
Cameras is looking
It's hard to channel your energy when you know you're crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirstHow many sins?
I'm running out
How many sins?
I lost count
Dreams are balled in like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper calling
I'm cottonmouth
Money is power, yours is ours
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song
A black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirstWhat are we doing?
Who are we fooling?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live right just by how to shoot it
Tired of running, choirs is humming
Tell us to visit, we lying about coming
Now back to business, loading the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is viewed
And the beef is bubbling
It's no discussion, hereditary
All of my cousins
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirstToo many sins
I'm running out
Somebody send
Me a well for the drought
See, all I know, is taking notes
On taking this life for granted
Granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days (Lord forgive me for all my sins for I not know...)
My best days, I stress days
Say "Fuck the world," my sex slave
Money, pussy and greed was my next crave
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of running, tired of running
Tired of tumbling, tired of running
Tired of tumbling
Back once my momma say
"See a pastor, give me a promise
What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst
You dying of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works"

Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fighting for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Now am I worth it?
Did I put enough work in?When the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about mePromise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about meTired of running
Tired of hunting
My own kind
But retiring nothing
Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirstDope on the corner
Look at the coroner
Daughter is dead
Mother is mourning her
Strayed bullets
AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently but they couldn't
Bring her back
Who got the footage?
Channel 9
Cameras is looking
It's hard to channel your energy when you know you're crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirstHow many sins?
I'm running out
How many sins?
I lost count
Dreams are balled in like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper calling
I'm cottonmouth
Money is power, yours is ours
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song
A black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirstWhat are we doing?
Who are we fooling?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live right just by how to shoot it
Tired of running, choirs is humming
Tell us to visit, we lying about coming
Now back to business, loading the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is viewed
And the beef is bubbling
It's no discussion, hereditary
All of my cousins
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirstToo many sins
I'm running out
Somebody send
Me a well for the drought
See, all I know, is taking notes
On taking this life for granted
Granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days (Lord forgive me for all my sins for I not know...)
My best days, I stress days
Say "Fuck the world," my sex slave
Money, pussy and greed was my next crave
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of running, tired of running
Tired of tumbling, tired of running
Tired of tumbling
Back once my momma say
"See a pastor, give me a promise
What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst
You dying of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works" 
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]Ughh
Yeah
Kendrick Lamar
Ha ha haha HAThis feels like, right in front of the freeway
And when I'm done this should be in front of a DJ
I watch whack rappers put their soul on Ebay
To expect excellence knowing their effortless
I don't have a preference, I dislike all
Say you run the globe? Well more like a disco ball
I spread love as well
Little nigga, big dreams, can bear-hug a whale into a lobster's tail
Ugh
Evacuate premises, rap's sinister suspicious (?)
The pastor stand back, the bible is open, the words have been spoken
The moon and the stars align with the bars
The broads are snapping their bras in broad day
Cops meeting their quota running for arcades
The three initial's on the pistols printed all K's
The end is almost near, inferior of nothing
Superior is an option and my synopsis is that I'm Frank Sinatra
On the roster, top running
Running races with my own shadow
Look in the mirror then I start to battle
A pyru is a crip, nah a pyru's just a value that is sure to be heard (?)
Like a fuckin sheep's cattle, niggas got some nerve
Talkin bout they move birds
Only thing I move now is a noun and a verb
I am now on the verge of telling the real story
Of a Compton native in the city "that kill for me"
Cus you fabricated the realness
The county building and the county children on food stamps
Grew up firing street cred, talkin about "whoop whamp"
But that's never the case
Just a good lawyer who can sever the case
Recording live from the city where the skinny niggas die and the semi bullets fly
Drinking Remy out bottle till the pain run dry
Like a desert
Once the Desert Eagle ride by, what you reppin?
What you reppin my nigga, you got a weapon?
Well I got a profession my nigga
It's called hip-hop since Pac was on gridlock
Me against the world every hour, every second my nigga
You want something, get something
I could start a career AND I can end one, I'm H1N1
UGH
Straight A student who flow stupid
Real raps get permanent income, UGH[Outro]
Beats and bars
Kendrick Lamar
Maestro whattup? 
I don't need, I don't need nobody
Please shut the front door and walk right in
In the land of the man who rock it hard for them
Super Solo Dolo attack, run into that
If you'd like to know, yes, I am on acid
Who could it be? K-I-D
Searching all day in the streets for DMT
Don't sip it, though it couldn't answer
Drip, drip all day bumpin' MGMT, homie
Watch who you hate on, fam', without the facts
Sad niggas back in the hood bumpin' Ratatat
To me it was a dream, a fiend to understand that
You never seen a nigga like me?
I just tell 'em I'm an oxymoron when I open my mouth
Cause people talk shit before knowing what I'm about
But for sure these Cleveland boys is ill
But pretty soon your gutter bitches wildin' for real, it's such a trip
Hoes around the globe, I'm known to have a fet'
I don't do a thing and these bitches lickin' they lips
Me and Chip reflect on all the hate and jibber jabber
Mmm, you almost got me, but sucker I'm not a sucker
Better get on back
You pussy motherfuckers get the Will Smith smack
And I am not a fronter, better look up the facts
The world know what it be
Mr. Rager, Solo Dolo see me and repeat itCome, come now, last call, who want some?
It's just me, two bitches and dirty drums
Two lips to kiss, 22 other nuns
God blessed my tongue, God need it for life
Awkward like car rides, twiddling my thumbs
Pondering my next accomplishments
It's condescending to say I won
Two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?I really want it I need it
Break bread or break fast
Before I blast and break legs, ride past
And they scream out "little Johnny is dead!"
You wish me well, I wish you hell
Eternity, no such thing as time will tell
Infirmary, burn like magnetic combustion
Bad credit with me, and paramedics are hustlin'
What's the definition of water?
Sherm sticks, simply got 'em everywhere you caught us
Turn quick, I don't wanna play this for my daughter
And if my son heard it, probably look at you as his father
I'm proud of myself in a bad way
Halfway house, tell that to me halfway
I'm passin' out, ass whoopin'
Your ass lookin' for Michelle Obama 'til I bang on you
They couldn'tCome, come now, last call, who want some?
It's just me, two bitches and dirty drums
Two lips to kiss, 22 other nuns
God blessed my tongue, God need it for life
Awkward like car rides, twiddling my thumbs
Pondering my next accomplishments
It's condescending to say I won
Two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?

Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drankNow I done grew up round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask back stroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular that was my problem
I was in the dark room loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'mma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd move
Changing by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to meNigga why you babysittin' only 2 or 3 shots?

I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick

I see the feelin' the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrive

Matter of fact she gone
Matter of fact Tyrone

Before we walk we must crawl, even when temptation calls
Before we walk we must crawl, even when temptation calls[J. Cole]
Left side, left side
right side, right sideYeah,
Often I'm caught up in confusion and need a dissolution
They tell me the solution is get through the illusion I'm living
A few friends killed, a few sent to prison
Our mama's tried to warn us but few tend to listen
See we running the streets in search of some trouble
At least a couple of freaks to sneak home with
Now she ride a n-gga dick just like she owned it
So every time I wanna hit, I bet ya she owned it
She got the bad lips, bad hips, damn shawty
Slim waist, Gina face, Pam body
Met her in the club, yet I look her to(?) love
Thats the reason my n-ggas can't find me
Good golly, look shawty, aint no need for games
I know a n-ggas still young but I done seen some things
If it's cool to talk, let me ease ya pain
This is food for thought, let me feed ya brain
Your ex-man did you dirty, did he leave a stain?
When them losers talk, tell em please refrain
I refuse to stop, don't freeze the frame
Cause tonight I got you calling out Jesus name[Hook]
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey
Before we walk we must crawl, even when temptation calls
Left side, left side, hey
right side, right side, hey
Before we walk we must crawl, even when temptation calls[Kendrick Lamar]
Often I'm caught up in confusion and tryna find solutions
to try and pimp the system, thats a form of prostitution
I'm ready, the city probably see me as a nuisance daily
Seeking the devil stone getting repetitive (?) I know
But shawty body and she admire that I'm a pyro-maniac
I say where you at and do you have Geico?
I need insurance that you could sex me the best
And she start sexing through text and send pictures under her dress
Got them G-Strings, you beasting for the pleasure and pain
I was a weakling so I cling to her under my name
I gave her the ding ding than dee ding, the bell ring in the game
It was intriging that she seemed to no stand, no flow
Keeping it wet, making it rain
Beg ya pardon, don't blow job, she no jobs like Tommy from Martin(?)
Dont blow jobs, she blow hard like a Nintendo cartridge
That blow job had (?) like Mozart
Got blow job than put it in her trunk like go ya (?)
I'm starving offa that Cuervo
Shop on Rodeo, house in the dagos
We like to f-cking watch the day go by
I tell her (?), drop the potato
She's hot, what can I say yo?[Hook]
Left side, left side, hey
Right side, right side, hey
Before we walk we must crawl, even when temptation calls
Left side, left side, hey
right side, right side, hey
Before we walk we must crawl, even when temptation calls 
 
[Kendrick Lamar]
Reporting live, from Compton, California
North CackalackNow everybody just bow to the greatness, or die in the matrix
You're hereby dating, my destiny's waiting
My itinerary is very hectic
I break records on every record, I'm truly reckless
Kendrick Lamar, know how to maul with my wrist
Shout to writers for holding it down bitch
Me and my down bitch, get busy
I'm busy taking over, the world
with the weight of the world on my shoulder
My drive is not to be chauffeured
I'm live, come to the harvest, welcome the artist
whose lyrics out of the orbit, more than the hardest rapper
to hit the market and market myself as a shooting target
with offers that got me up in these offices often
Boo-yaa, boo-yaa, no one, I've done situated myself, I ain't lying
Be sure to be friend cause my foes die five times
The good kid from the mad city
Holding a cereal box instead of a Glock
In a 1992 Caddilac that I got from my pops
Transmission slipping, but I ain't tripping, swallow my pride
Pop in my tape and roll the window, down
like Stacie homie when airing out endo
I wish a nigga would[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock[Rapper Big Pooh]
Yo, it's evident, I'm evidently your favorite
All I ask, open your ears and please savor it
The taste is un-acquired, quietly, been inspired
I'm at a point in my life when I was getting tired
Now I'm brushing off the dust
We don't need no water, fire burned it to the dust
Nigga grind hard, roaches turning into musk
People hear his pain, I consider that a plus
I'm a grown man, so a few I have trust to Do the Right Thing
The Spike thing, consider me the in-between
The new regime taking over
Either we each other's opposition or you soldier
Used to have the whole state of NC on my shoulder then I passed it
off to the next, you unlucky bastard
I'm getting drunk same time every year
to celebrate the life, Rosie no longer here
I swear[Chorus][Kendrick Lamar]
Me and Big Pooh like the definition of a two-man city zoo
Even zoos can beat up from punchlines
When I kick it and pump mine, I've got to be a prophet
I've gotta make a profit big enough to have a thirty pound wallet
I'm a Hub City representer, so I've got to represent the
city like a District Attorney being the case for killers
Might walk around in gurney, this is my sickest winter
since I had the flu and flew in the hospital with the shivers[Rapper Big Pooh]
U-P-S, I (deliver)
Little brown boy get the pick of the litter
No glitter, all guts, no glory
Station on repeat, they retread the same story
New niggas bore me, tryna progress to that old shit
Have a plate, that food for your soul tip
Drill it in your head, youngun it's that real Hip-
Hop along 'fore you get your little ass whipped[Chorus] 
Everybody, everybody
Everybody
Everybody sit your bitch ass down and
Listen to this true mothafuckin' story told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitchSmoking on the finest dope
Aye aye aye aye
Drank until I can't no mo'
Aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't asking for no favors
Rush a nigga quick then laugh about it later
Aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now
And momma used to say
One day, it's gon' burn you out
One day, it's gon' burn you out, out
One day, it's gon' burn you out
One day, it's gon' burn you
I'm with the homies right nowMe and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate
If it's necessary
Bumping Jeezy first album looking distracted
Speaking language only we know, you think is an accent
The windows roll down all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxing like George Foreman grilling the masses
Of the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of working girls
And asked them what they working with - look at me
I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I'm drug-free, but shit I'm with the homiesIt's 2:30 and the sun is beaming
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screaming
Hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick then I'll continue eating
We speeding on the 405 passing Westchester
You know the light skin girls in all the little dresses, good Lord
They knew we weren't from 'round there
'Cause every time we down there we pulling out the Boost Mobile sim cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like then started interrogating
I never was a gangbanger, I mean I was never stranger to the funk neither
I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That's ironic 'cause I've never been violent, until I'm with the homies(Just ridin', just ridin')
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin', actin' a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin', really trippin')
Me and the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin'...)Bragging 'bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessey didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt you
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playing and our attitude is still "nigga, what is you saying"
Pull in front of the house that we been camping out for like two months
The sun is going down as we take whatever we want
(Ay, ay, nigga cash out, pop the safe
Ay nigga, I think it's somebody in this room
Wait, what?
Nigga, it's somebody in this room!)
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVDs, plasma screen TVs in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circling life
My mama called - "Hello? What you doin'? "Kicking it"
I should've told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense with the homiesBut they made a right, they made a left then made a right
Then another right
One lucky night with the homiesK. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yea we finally got that nigga faded. I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well which one he talking 'bout? I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I prayed he hit that
Nah, that nigga straight. He ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans
Nigga I think we should push back to the city, fo real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga, what's that Jeezy song say nigga?
"Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!"
Yea, yea, that shit right there. I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan luv. We gon' use the kickback as a alibi
Wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission,
Drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park
Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonightThen we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight but we should meet up around 12, I'm tryna fuck on something too
Nigga sit yo dumb ass back down, nigga you ain't doing shit tonight
Matter fact, nigga get in the mothafuckin' car
We finna get active 
Everybody, everybody
Everybody
Everybody sit your bitch ass down and
Listen to this true mothafuckin' story told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitchSmoking on the finest dope

Everything black, I don't want black
I want everything black, I ain't need black
Some white some black, I ain't mean black
I want everything black
Everything black, I don't want black
I want everything black, I ain't need black
Some white some black, I ain't mean black
I want everything blackSix in the morning, fire in the street
Burn baby burn, that's all I wanna see
And sometimes I get off watching you die in vain
It's such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or something but homie you made me
Black don't crack my niggaI'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelins, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real niggaThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember thatI'm the biggest hypocrite in 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean it's evident I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me till I'm dead
Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'mma be another slave in my head
Institutionalize manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels bout
I'm black and successful, this black man meant to be special
CAT scans on my radar bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you that I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real niggaThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember thatI'm the biggest hypocrite in 2015
When I finish this if you listenin' I'm sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Dareous
Excuse my French but fuck you, no fuck ya'll
That's as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell because it's threats when I see you
I can tell because your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you're in love with the Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Piru's, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers"
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street?
When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite! 
Don't tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you
Don't tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you30 millions later, my future favors
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Travel round the atlas in this spaceship candy-coated
My day shift's been devoted to fuckin' up bundles of paper
Pi equals 3.14
The devil's pie is big enough to justify the whole thing
Wait up
Lampin' in Jamaica, the cloud's turnin', my thought's turnin'
Burnin' castor oil, I been determined to make an earnin'
This seed in this soil is classified
I'm satisfied when I strategize my kid's future
I ain't sanctified enough to say that I won't shoot ya
I done vandalized the industry full circuit
The earthiest slash thirstiest nigga you know versus this
Scum of a land that transcend two surfaces
The richer the poorer, the bigger the picture
The more blood pours, butDon't tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you
Don't tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout youMy fans can't wait for me to son ya punk ass and crush your whole lil shit
I'll Big Pun ya punk ass, you a scared little bitch
Tiptoein' around my name, nigga, ya lame
And when I get at you, homie, don't you just tell me you was just playin'
Oh I was just playin' with you K-Dot, c'mon
You know a nigga rock with you, bro
Shut the fuck up, you sound like the last nigga I know
Might end up like the last nigga I know
Oh, you don't wanna clash? Nigga, I know
I put my foot on the gas, head on the floor
Hoppin' out before the vehicle crash, I'm on a roll
Yellin', "One, two, three, four, five
I am the greatest rapper alive"
So damn great, motherfucker, I've died
What you hearin' now is a paranormal vibe
House on the hill, house on the beach, nigga (facts)
A condo in Compton, I'm still in reach, nigga (facts)
I'm fresh out the water I'm 'bout to breach, nigga
The five-foot giant woke up out of his sleep, nigga
Oh yeah, oh yeah, more cars, more leers
More bars, no peers, no scars, no fear, fuck y'all, sincere
I heard the whispers, I curved the whispers, you know what the risk is
Earth indigenous, ya body reverting to stiffness
The whole world goin' mad
Bodies is adding up, market's about to crash
Niggas is fake rich, bitches is fake bad
Blacks that act white, whites that do the dab
Donald Trump is a chump, know how we feel, punk
Tell 'em that God comin'
And Russia need a replay button, y'all up to somethin'
Electorial votes look like memorial votes
But America's truth ain't ignorin' the votes
It's blasphemy, how many gon' blast for me?
I prophesied on my last song, you laughed at me
Oh, when the shit get brackin', don't you ask for me
How many leaders gon' tell you the truth after me?

It's sad, daddy
My only advice? Go and get you a bag, daddy
Lee Baca, on trial tryna portray a boxer
Beatin' up on my niggas while the COs watch 'em
Tables turned, lesson learned, my best look
You jumped sides on me, now you 'bout to meet Westbrook
Go celebrate with your team and let victory vouch you
Just know the next game played, I might slap the shit out you
Technical foul, I'm flagrant, I'm foul
They throwin' me out, you throw in the towel
Look at the crowd, they (Nah, I don't like that)
Look at my smile, I'm smirking
Calm but urgent (That ain't the style, fuck)
So many verses, you live in denial (Fuck)
So many verses, I never run out, what?
You making him nervous, the music is loud
Hoe, Jay Z Hall of Fame, sit your punk ass down (Sit yo' punk ass down)
So that means you ain't bigger than rapping (What else?)
So that means no more playing the backseats (What else?)
My spot is solidified if you ask me (What else?)

A difference between accomplishments and astonishments

Thank you
Sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go
Right now, freestyle or write down, whatever
It still'll come up clever
I just need to free my thoughts, and Lord knows that I know better
But I ain't perfect, I ain't seen too many churches
Or know them testament verses
You should either hear me now or go deaf
Or end up dead, die trying and know death
Might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath
Fuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect nigga
I mean that from the bottom of my heart
You see my art, is all I have
And victory tastes sweet, even when the enemy can throw salt
Still knock them out the park like a fucking tow car
Let bygones be bygones, but where I'm from
We buy guns and more guns, to give to the young
I'm living the life of a nigga trapped nigga
Inside the system all you envision is trap niggas
My uncle doing life inside prison he wasn't wrapped too tight
He told me rap about life, not rap niggas
That's why I'm shaking my head when you rap dissin'
My stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching
I start evaluating, then my final intuition
Is that you wishing a come up, would just come up
We used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse
Niggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre
And this is Comp-ton, lions in the land of the triumph
Wrap saran our defiance, ban our alliance
Put burners in the hands, of the black man
One hood with 20 four-four's like a cloned Kobe Bryant
You probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am
You probably even listen to Faith, and think I know Zion
But really I'm just caught in the loop, of understanding the truth
Because it seem like it's always clashing with science
I got a big fear of flying
My future so bright I'd probably go blind before I blink twice, I ain't lying
I swear to God half of ya'll just don't know Kendrick
The school of hardknocks, we was the first ones in attendance
You walking down the block, he got shot, you are no eye witness
You just mind your business
You just turn your head, kneel down and then tie your tennis
It's kind of scary ain't it?
You can't act like no bitch, that only got Tyler Perry famous
Just let me explain this, why you pick up that stainless
Cuz your pops wasn't anxious
To see you and you hate it
So much you probably had your burner tucked at graduation
So if you see him on 'em bleachers then you kill him
Facing 25 to life with a murder charge
Your enemies was the prey and now you pray to God
I pray these bars get farther than Compton
And if our record never break, I still won't break my promise
I promise to keep it honest
Secret society all we ask is trust
And all we lack is communication like service sucks
The people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come
And I'm like
The Kendrick Lamar OD in less than a month, alright?
Gotta keep it pushing
Can't let the government tell me how my future looking
I'm on Rosecrans and Central trying to duck the central bookins'
If the fucking pigs get behind me then you know I'm bookin'
Never will I surrender
I been a warrior when I came out my mom's placenta
In the gutter lane like I'm Master Splinter
How splendid, I guess my project had did it
Got all these niggas approaching they mixtapes different
They said seven tracks, I said fifteen
Called it an EP, they said I'm trippin'
But little did they know, I'm tryna' change the rules
That we've been confined to, so the corporate won't make decisions
Uppity bitches, handling business
Killing our dreams, stealing our vision
Out in Haiti, adolescents barely have a home
In L.A everybody think they fucking on
Hop on twitter, perpetrate we doing big shit
Who we hanging with and bragging about the iPhone
I swear to God most of y'all cats just don't know Kendrick
You barely know yourself, so I guess most of y'all should be offended
Ain't doing this for my health I'm tryna' purchase my momma dem' Benzes
Occupying my time with riches, justifying my time ambitions
Just to coincide, just to go inside, plus we idolize why we living
Look the mastermind, took the master's mind
Just the perfect time, just to master mine
Just to match the grind with precision
Look the mastermind, took
Cause of you we are Overly Dedicated 
[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
One two, one two, one two
One two, one two, one two
One two
Turn the headphones up Ali
One two
You mix with Dre, right?
Turn the headphones up[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
When the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated
That's enough pressure to live your whole life sedated
Find the tallest building in Vegas and jump off it
But I could never rewrite history in a coffin
So I'm talking to God, "Can you wash all these demons off me?"
This last year I've been quite similar to Aaliyah
Control my own destiny, only rapper that steered
A G5, g's give high-fives to me and say, "Kendrick, just persevere."
The presence of being real
As I lay in this four corner room staring at candles
Thinking, "How can I make an example, for this generation of Compton?"
My biggest fear is not feeling accomplished
Or turning back to that same accomplice
My past life was a child with no act right
Trying to smile in a room of killers, turn into a crash site
Influenced by niggas that spoke the gang culture fluent
Assuring that some blossom early and some truant
Thank God for the album I idolized
It's dark and plus hell is hot, that's the start of this crazy ride
Two young niggas, me and Dave inside the garage
And thought we was Jay and Dame
Thats the lane that we tried to drive
Truthfully, I just started rappin' to get away
I never thought that your favorite rapper would want a verse
My nigga got hit 25 times with a K
Make the decision, ride the beat or ride in a hearse
Now Punch is my mentor, Top Dawg is the coach
Jay Rock is my older brother, I was there when he wrote
His name on his record deal, we had figured the coast
Would live on a pedestal, once the shit hit the store
Found ourselves scrambling, tryna figure it out
Soul told me that the record shop 'bout to go in a drought
Q ain't got a place to stay, and 'bout to sleep on the couch
We eating off each other tray, the dollar menu amount
Meanwhile the coast going hard at each other
The younger rappers had wanted some of the OGs' comfort
But I ain't need it
I never screamed out the 'New West', I didn't believe it
They brought each other down, I was planning out my achievements
I need to separate myself to stand out
I need a better way to take your fans now
I need to kill you motherfuckers dead
Three hollow tips aimed at your head
I'll be damned if the chopper jam now
And we never asked for no hand out
In the midst of it all I recall a call when you said how
We could never resolve in The Hall of Fame
And I'm with the trial with a Bible and a rifle
I play the game as I plan blow
Hollaback at me, nigga
And if they said that I'm the one, why you asking me, nigga?
Cause when the whole world see you as Pac reincarnated
Enough pressure to make you just open the Book of David
And pray to God that ya make it or live your life in the matrix
Cause falling off is a sickness, I heard that it's quite contagious
I need to separate myself to stand out
I need a better way to take your fans now
I need to kill you motherfuckers dead
Three hollow tips aimed at your head[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I'll be damned if the chopper jam now
And we never asked for no hand out
I'll take you back to that pack of Black & Milds in my hand now
In the midst of it all was cooking with pots and pans out
Looking forward as four of us are forced to form a new clan now
Fast forward as I wait in line for this passport
The homies was still poor, was working at Jansport[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Whoever thought that Rosenberg would mention me to Dre?
Even Vanessa from XXL had told him to press play
And there goes my fate, now I'm on stage with Snoop
Gave me the torch and I ran with it in high pursuit
Rapped with my forefathers, even record with Gaga too
Lyricist of the year, fuck am I supposed to do? Rock[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
Laughing at you niggas out there who thought we was flukes
Exaggerated shit that we rapped had came true
Thought I was aggravated, when Warner had let me loose
I was honest, see they was haunted when Mike Jones didn't recoup[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
Cool, cause niggas won't outdo us in the booth
Even when my album leak, fans still buy it for proof
I came, I saw, I conquered
No shame, I blame all of this on Compton
Thinking about when Sherane tried to set me up
Cold game, full circle, they set up her
I put my life in these twelve songs, my fight in these twelve songs
The fight to ignite any wrong or right that I prolong
The story was short film, the glory of him and them
The worry of mothers that don't recover when baby killed
The trial and the tribulations, the newer Miseducation
The view of a body wasting, you knew somebody who ain't make it
The angry, the adolescent, the reason I ask this question
Will you let Hip-Hop die on October 22nd?
Will you let Hip-Hop die on October 22nd? 
Thank you
Sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go
Right now, freestyle or write down, whatever
It still'll come up clever
I just need to free my thoughts, and Lord knows that I know better
But I ain't perfect, I ain't seen too many churches
Or know them testament verses
You should either hear me now or go deaf
Or end up dead, die trying and know death
Might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath
Fuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect nigga
I mean that from the bottom of my heart
You see my art, is all I have
And victory tastes sweet, even when the enemy can throw salt

[Intro]
Praise to the almighty, HiiiPower
Me and my niggas (Live forever)
3 eyes to my alumni
Feel this
I wanna hear it, turn me up (My niggas on point, game tight)
Turn me up a little bit more nigga (My niggas on point, game tight)
My nigga Cole in this motherfucker. Wassup nigga?
(My niggas on point, game tight)
There we go yeah, turn me up[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Picture plenty pussies throwing pellet guns at me
Paranoia making it more than difficult for me to sleep
Pinnacle, I know I be, centerfold, I know I got
But they hate to frame me as the Mona Lisa of Hip-Hop
So retaliation is a must, when we bend the block
My niggas dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put TNT inside my suit
Walk inside the label, struck a match, and then I blew, bomb
C4 everywhere, C4 everywhere
I got three whores with me, it smells like Dior and derriÃ¨re
Decoys die slow, you can detour to Heaven's stairs
Or walk inside Hell's dungeon, I just might derail something
They pussies, I smell something
You douche on the daily, niggas, you pushin' up daisy
I push the gas on the Mercedes, nigga
Came in this game with a Rolie chain, and a dream
Became reality, made some casualties, my choppers scream[Hook: Kendrick Lamar (x2)]
And now we dump'n out the roof, (Do-do-do-do-do)
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Uh, me K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Uh, walk inside the label, struck a match and then I blew[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga that thought Good Kid gon' flop, or that I might go pop
Or your bitch won't drop, knees when my shit drop
Y'all too infatuated with the fucking numbers
Which make it easy for me to divide and conquer
I come from Compton, we ain't have it all
Smokers basing inside the cafeteria hall
And I'm putting fear in you all, see your skeletons shaking
Jump out your body, you Ricky Bobby until you naked
Y'all pray to God this week I be putting out bombs
I pray to God this beat is good enough for Shyne
If not J. Cole, your shit is trash
But at least my opinion just made everyone laugh
This is where we at? I guess it's entertainment
I guess this is speculation making a classic came with
If I ain't have the patience I'd probably self destruct
Real people want real music, the jig is up[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & J. Cole]
Your worst fear is confirmed
We love that you crashed and burned
The real is back
K. Dot it's your turn, take your victory lap
King Cole salutin' Compton's own King Kendrick
Thats the sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
The city hail King Kendrick Lamar
The world hail King Kendrick Lamar[Hook: Kendrick Lamar (x2)][Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
This is my life and I look at it like its my last
And I'm lookin' right past the future as I reminisce on my past
And I don't even think how I used to, my mind is on rocket blast
And I don't even drink like I used too, and I don't even smoke
So you know this natural flow is for users since they want to go to rehab
Lookin' at the coke that he had, matter fact that followers bother them
Then but I won't say my bad, see I just lay in the cut
Watch the product stack up, motherfucker what what
See now we dump'n out the roof 
Every morning when I wake up, uh, money on my mind
Good times and get caked up, uh, sunshine coming through my blinds
I'm living but, really though, it's never enough
10 milli on, that's a must, living in California
Everybody wanna visit for (Women, weed and weather)
They come for (Women, weed and weather)
(For the women, weed and weather)
From all around the world for the (Women, weed and weather)
These niggas'll kill for that, put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
How the fuck can't y'all see I ride, when I drive, down the block and
You look outside, H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
It's a beautiful day I guess for a bitch to roll with Andre I guess
Roll it up, baby come lift that dress then roll it up for me when I'm stressedYou might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living

Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
You want to be one, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga, let 'em know the priority order me
Hennessy and for my niggas OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees
Boy he's on his job, boy he sure be having the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controlling my vice
No way hell no, uh uh, if I'm wrong I don't wanna be right
You want to be one, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled offYou might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss

I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the sameIf these walls could talkSex, she just want to close her eyes and sway
If you, if you, if you exercise your right to forget it
Its true, its true, its true, shout out to the birthday girls say hey
Say hey, everyone deserves a night to play
And shes plays only when you tell her noIf these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in itIf these walls could talk they'd tell me to swim good
No boat I float better than he would
No life jacket I'm not the guard in Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Wall telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me? I'm just a tenant
My lord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean its still amazing before they couldn't stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I'm here
These walls never could hold up
Everytime I come around demolition might crushIf these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in itIf these walls could talk they'd tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down that's my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don't know how long I can wait in these walls
I've been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must've missed them
I'm not involved I'd rather diss them
I'd rather call all you put your wall up
Cause when I come around demolition gon' crushIf these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in itIf your walls could talk they'd tell you it's too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them where they are
Take the recipe, the bible and god
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies say to you, you're reputable, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like a killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to "Sing About Me"
Retaliation is strong you even dream about me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted the same night
So when you play this song rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fucking on a famous rapper
Walls could talkI remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room 
"Boarding completed I'd like to welcome you aboard flight number F2B3
Our scheduled flying time will be four hours and twenty minutes
And we will be cruising at an altitude of thirty-three-thousand feet
At this time we would like to acquaint you with some of the features
Relax and breathe normally"
Uh, coming down like I'm uphill
Hogging both lanes better than a bus will
She tell me that my head bigger than a bus wheel
But it don't matter cause she still gon' let me fuck still
I mix a little bit of Kendrick with some L.A. weather
Then step out like Chicago in its finest era
You niggas begging for attention, doing extra-extra
Downgrading yourself, you get an F for effort
Ha-ha, I let the world know
I chose to keep to myself and let the world go
And if you don't like a nigga, then let your girl know
So she can be curious on Twitter looking me up
I'm laid back with a bad one, you ain't never had one
Ass so fat that it tipped over the Aston
Speeding on the 1-0-5 till the fucking badge come
Hello to my wittiness, I'm Cadillac's grandson
And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat,
I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
Cause I'm a trip
Landing on another runway, fly with me
Or die tryna fly, a shot-down Frisbee
Shout out to Black Hippy, nigga we on
Like we never been off, straight shots of Patron
I'm give y'all the business to give y'all some business
Pussy ain't shit, I can give y'all some bitches
Clean off her sports bra, she clean off my dishes
Then wear off the Kangols
hood rats, I hate those
And she know what this is
hey lil' mama
Seen your pretty ass around the way lil' mama
But why you always in somebody face lil' mama?
Embarrassing yourself, get off the stage (Lil Mama)
Nigga, I gotta be that nigga
If I ain't, I gotta be that nigga
Curtesy of Paula's oldest son, pay homage
Or pay attention, open your eyes and hear knowledge
Gi-give me that, gi-gi-give me that
That's how I get at 'em when I look at a shoe rack
Penny for thoughts, mine start at a few racks
So I can live on a hill just off a few raps
I want to live in a space that none of y'all can visit
That might be outer space, the Jupiter district
I quadruple my vision
If you don't see it then you're dead with your eyes open
I've seen bullets hit the wheel, left his ride smoking
On some Compton shit
Somebody that'll ride or die, that's a Compton bitch
You see my city is the city of Lamar
It'll take twenty years 'fore a nigga see them all
The swap meet dumping, the sawed-off pumping
The tree for the low, don't you know, Paul Bunyan
I'm on cloud nine, I can see rain coming
So if I'm out my mind, people don't say nothing
"How was your flight Mr. Lamar?
Good, hope to see you next time" 
Scene 1: Screams
(00:00 - 00:30)
With the opening screams the audience can also sense that something is eerie; these sounds are in the original track combined creating a dangerous visual. Then beginning to see Kendrick pouring his heart out in to his liquor in a schizophrenic manner.
Scene 2: The Hotel Room
(00:30 - 01:26)
Hearing the chorus "Loving you is complicated" - the image starts to depict that there is an internal struggle going on with him loving himself. The scene is immensely minimalistic and filled with dark lighting, this accompanied by his throne like chair creates for a deep setting for imagery to take a place in the film.
Scene 3: Mirror
(01:27 - 01:57)
The mirror representative of an internal reflection; as the struggle of how he views himself as the words utter "I ****** tell you, you ****** failureâyou ain't no leader!", the negatively intrinsic views we beginnings to see why he hates himself for the mistakes he has made.
Scene 4: Tipsy
(01:57 - 02:10)
Stumbling all over the place into his throne - blurred visions of the camera shaking around giving us P.O.V (Point of Vision) of what it is like to be overly intoxicated.
Scene 5: Room Service
The skit from 'u' begins to play before we hear the drunk Lamar entering in the next scene.
Dialogue

(2) Transitional Slide - '8'
Scene 6 Part 1: Spinning Bottle
(02:37 - 03:42)
A very unique and a extremely interesting shot with a spinning bottle in the back ground seemingly to play spin the bottle by himself.
Notice this high angle shot focusing down on Lamar with a demonic reflection in the background of the mirror choosing to do it's own thing every now and then.
Scene 6 Part 2: Smashed Mirror
(03:30 - 03:42)
An easily missed technique of a reflection of himself breaking the mirror of reality down, smashing into pieces before the screen goes black into the next slide.

[Credits - 'For Sale']

(03:43 - 07:11)

(8) Transitional Slide - 'Always trust a n**** with cornrows'
Scene 3: Lost/Distractions
(04:10)

(9) Transitional Slide - 'Time is change, your friend or foe'
(10) Transitional Slide - 'Never trust a n**** with too many haircuts'
(11) Transitional Slide - 'Tracee Ellis Ross is vibrant'
Scene 4: Demonic Eyes
(04:24 - 04:38)

(05:59 - 06:09)

How the industry strips you down for what you have got like strippers and take your money and keep you trapped in their vicious cycle.

Scene 10: Unexpected bridge cut 
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I was sitting on the couch reading yellow paper
A letter in reply, 7 days later after I wrote 'em
"Stay strong, keep your faith in God," what I told him
Hoping that he's listening
Said that they tried to give him like a hundred years
What a coincidence, I was bumping some Plies
I can taste the salt from my tears
As the water had start to flood on my eyes
I know it gotta be hard being 21
Doing time in the pen and your Gram's old
Your brother's getting older
And the streets is getting colder
And your hoping that he's focused to stay on the right road
Sleeping in a cell, it's been 30 weeks
Ain't recieved any mail
It's cold and the hole stinks
And you can't even blink without niggas testing your life
As I read every word that you write, I can only imagine
Jason Keaton, I can only imagine[Hook: Javonte]
Life's about decisions man
It's in your hand and you got it
Just take control if you can
It's in your hand and you got it[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Sitting on the couch, that was my Uncle Bobby
After he just got out, 15 years to count
Haven't seen the world in so long
Haven't seen a girl in so long
And before the sun came up, he was gone
Like a fiend off the best rock
Trying to get his life together, or what not
Typed his name in the system and they couldn't find his identity
Got it straight, got a place, found some serenity
Found a job, found his Mother's grave site, found a 40 ounce
Then he found God, then he bounced, then he found a new chick
Two kids, wide hips, found something in her we didn't see
Found this spot in Pasadena and shack with her, an investment
Then found guilty, somebody had yelled domestic
Violence on my Uncle, was working with two strikes
Only out a year, now facing life
I can only imagine
That's fucked up
I can only imagine, Uncle Bob[Hook][Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Sitting on the couch, thinking about the ratio
Of blacks in prison as compact in prison
When blacks pack with minorities
System grab more of these 18 year olds
18 year sentence with no parole
The state won't oversee
They make the term severe, a conspiracy?
That's what I call it, it's full of shit
A toilet can help quick, the government help?
No, just put us on death row
Just give us some more guns, then give us some more coke
Then give us another chair, then give us some more rope
Then hang it like right there, yeah
It's justice for all but 90 percent unfair
Care? No
Alcatraz was purchased by a white man
For 5 grand, with intentions to expand
More prisons
So these correctionals ain't for rehabilitation
They for grossing a bigger business
Imagine
We're being used
Imagine
The truth shall be told[Hook][RIP Uncle Bobby Part 2]

Young Egypt
Look, look
I feel like Pacino in Godfather, I'm charged
Our father who art in Heaven, Kendrick at large
Came in the game with a plan of beatin' the odds
What an accomplishment, broken promises
Kept my focus anonymous 'til I dealt with the consequence
The greatest and latest mogul, you know what time it is
You niggas fear me like y'all fear God
You sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of making your choice and writin' your bars
Before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital, avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies
With batteries to the head
The flattery of watchin' my stock rise
The salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
Just premium gas, do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
Black excellence, pessimist died countin' my coin
Hope it's evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better
I blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and Bimmers and blue leather
Forcasted my future, this is the future
The mastermind until my next album, more power to youCome onThis is a fifteen minute song
We're just jammin' out, we on stage
Taz, we just jammin' out
Hundred thousand
Hundred thousand, you gotta see it!
Look, look, look, go back to the down note
They all sing this shit, everybodyNow I don't let you down, and for
You see, you see, you see, you see
But I don't shake you down, dog for you, you, you, you
They say the government ain't the truth, truth, truth, truth
And the politicians always mislead the youth, youth, youth, youthBut head is the answer
Head is the future
Don't second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
Hey one more time, band, I need y'all to help me out right now
Head is the answer
Head is the future, it's the future, that nigga said
Don't second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
Say come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, my background singing
Come onI said, girl you make me wanna uh
The whole screaming now
I said baby you make
You make me wanna just ah!
Baby you got me speechless right now

To the ground, to the ground ground
Like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
You just make me wanna Drake you down
Down, around like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
And baby if your mama's around, if your mama's around
If your mama's around, if your mama's around

We gonna lay that shit, and watch what it's gon' do 
Come here, girl
Oh, you want me to touch you right there?
Oh, like a little lamb, play in your hair
Oh you want it? Oh you want it right now
Like that? I got you baby
All on you baby
Push it back on daddy
Push it back on daddy babyI seen it vividly jogging my brain memory, life is
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory
Life is long as infinity this was the final calling
No birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking
We all nervous and crying, moving in caution
In disbeliefs our believe's the reason for all this
The tallest building plummet, cracking and crumbling
The ground is shaking, swallowing young woman
With a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction
The smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable
Preachers touching on boys run for cover, they paranoid
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
Valleys and high places turn into dust
Famous screaming in agony
Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky
Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling "he's alive"
Backpedaling christians settling for forgiveness
Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
Ocean water dried out, fire burning more tires out
Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
Public bathroom, college classroom's been deserted
Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
(It's happening) no more running from world wars
(It's happening) no more discriminating the poor
(It's happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas
Wishing for green and gold the last taste of allure
I swore I seen it vividly
A moniker of war from heaven that play the symphony
Thunder like number four, then I heard
"What have you did for me"
I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume
That dated back to June 17th, 1987
My paperwork was like a receipt
I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment
But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
Close my eyes pray to god that I live forever
Dark skies, fire and brimstone some of us sent home
Some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
Geez Louise I thought you said that I excel
I made To Pimp a Butterfly 'fore you told me
To use my vocals to save man-kind for you
Say I didn't try for you, say I didn't ride for you
I tied for you, I pushed the club to the side for you
Who love you like I love you?
Crucifix, tell me you can fix
Anytime I need, I'mma start jotting everything in my diary
Never would you lie to me
Always camaraderie, I can see, our days been numbered
Revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet
All man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse
I guess I'm running in place trying to make it to churchYoung nigga act an ass
Young nigga act a fool
Young nigga get yo' cash
Young nigga do what it do
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Whatever makes all of you happy in this bitch
Just take it all back before the light switch 
Pimp-pimp hooray
Pimp-pimp hooray
Hooray
Pimp-pimp hooray

Parallel park like an alien, can't visit
Slideshow for the nice show, ten bitches
Fine nose with a blindfold, King Kendrick
(Hello Billy)
So many plays on me I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I confess
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil
A father figure fuck with him, you get killed
Fuck with me and he will kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juggin' like that

Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son dripping in gold
Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes
Me, I'm about to let my hair down on hoes

Sounwave caught a Grammy last year
Mack wop, bet he do what he want
Fuck you niggas, level two I'm not done
2Teez told me that I am the one
I can put a rapper on life support
Guarantee that's something that none of you want
Ten homies down and they all serving life
Water's like twenty-five hundred a month
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I certified all of these ones?
Bitch I get buck, I'm as real as they come
Shit is amazing, I'm feeding my cravings
You know that you want me come here now lil' baby

Yep all day, mortal man and Kunta
Alright, from the top! 
(What did the Asian say?)
A peace of mind
That's what the Asian said, I need a divine
Intervention was his religion and now it's a prize
Him believing in Buddha, me believing in God
Asked me what am I doing, he said "taking my time"
Meditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try
See you thinking too much plus you too full of yourself
Worried about your career, you ever think of your health?
(What did the Indian say?)
A piece of land
That's what the Indian said, I needed demand
Telling me longevity is in the dirt, should buy some property first
Profit a better dollar with generational perks
Equity at his best, really, you should invest
These tangible things expire, don't you expect
Income with so much outcome and yes
Look at my heritage, we blessed
(Now what the black man say?)
A piece of pussy
That's what the black man said, I needed to push me
To the limit, satisfy my hunger
We do it all for a woman, from hair cut to a wool
We like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach
What you saying to me?
He said "nigga, come back to reality for a week"
Pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night
I wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it
(What the white man say?)
A piece of mines
That's what the white man wanted when I rhyme
Telling me that he selling me just for $10.99
If I go platinum from rapping, I do the company fine
What if I compromise? He said it don't even matter
Make a million or more, you living better than average
You losing your core following, gaining it all
Put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw
Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw
Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
Look at what you accomplished and what he said to the boy
I'mma make you some promises that you just can't ignore
Your profession anonymous as an artist
If I don't target your market
You ain't signing your signature when I throw you my wallet
A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
Your world tour, your masters, mortgage, I need a pieceWhat you do? What you say?"
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today
I holler What you do? What you say?"
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today 
They say the government mislead the youth, youth, youth
(Tell 'em when you went to the park and everybody came back and)
And welfare don't mean well for you, you, you, you
(What about when you tried to do a side for that but you)
They tell me that my bill's past due, due, due, due
(Talk about the charge you got)
And preacher man don't always tell the truth, truth, truth
(Do you believe in God if you thought it's cool?)But head is the answer, head is the future
Don't second guess yourself
(Don't tell them when you second guess yourself I need you in the kitchen now I forgot)
Come on give me some help, yeah
Head is the answer, do it for the future girl
Don't second guess yourself
Come on give me some helpAnd I just wanna
Straight up
Eyes with my head
And I can't use some help
Straight upHead is the future 
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And that means the world to me
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And this I knowI got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my trunk
Name in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk
Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular I'm drunk
How can I make them popular, pop em' when I want
See I'm livin' with anxiety, duckin' sobriety
Fuckin' up the system I ain't fuckin' with society
Justice ain't free, therefore justice ain't me
So I justify his name on obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God
Now I'm thinkin' to myself, hollow tips is all I got
Now I'm drinkin' by myself, at the end of Section Park
Watch you when you walk inside your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your fuckin' door and blowin' out
Every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms
Cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain
I'm goneSomebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And that means the world to me
Drove alone, with a bottle of his own grippin' the handleLit off henny, I'm tryna dismantle
These wicked ways, I've engaged in such a gamble
Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel, wait
That's a bit ambitious maybe I'm trippin'
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension
Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance
It's such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night
I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall
Studied the son of God but still don't recognize my flaws
I guess I'm lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful
I pray my experience helps you
As for me I'm tryna sort it out
Searching for loop holes in my bruised soul
But who knows?
I just need a little space to breathe
I know perception is key, so I am king 
These metamorphic supernatural forces dominate what I see
A Gemini, do I let these personalities always conflict in meOh! But don't be scared of me, girl
I can't explain
I know it's foreign to you
I know it's hard to believe
God give me the favorLet me can explain
More than a compliment
And I could use some assistance, let me show you
I can explain
Or should I know? I spend about two times
I'll be there with the answer
Let me explain
I reside
I want God
Both sides of me are evenly odd
It's attractive
You're intrigued
Am I mortal man or make believe?
Anything you want
I can explain
Any misunderstandings, baby
Let me explain
Why don't you sit and talk to me?
I can explain it
Let me explainMy mama told me that I was different the moment I was invented
Estranged baby, no I'm not ashamed
I recommend every inch of your lunatic ways
Praise the lord, you teach the kids how to be themself and plenty more
You know the male species can be redundant
I mean we love a woman and think we can satisfy her
Between sheets, covers and pillows
I'm promising your lack of tolerance stuck on a 0
I'm promising that I'm acknowledging you as my hero
Cause you believe in me
No you're not easily impressed
But I possess qualities that you need to see
Look at my flaws, look at my flaws
Look at my imperfections and all
Look how you think that my mystique is a round of applause
And yours equally valued
You stick out like an alien compared to those around you
And that's alright because I like it
You and me are the same
Hopefully I'm invited, hopefully you don't change
Because I know for sure who you areI can explain
Your mama raised you, your daddy raised you
Hand washing your clothes on Sunday
Let me explain
Walking your brother to school, three miles away
To feed him knowledge
I can explain
Don't you explain that, don't you explain the reason why your mind can travel
Let me explain
I wanna know what you think
I wanna pick your brain when I see you
But don't you ever
Let me explain
Or should I know?
I spin around two times, a blessing in disguise
I can explain
I know for sure who you are
You're the goddess of the eye
I am yours
I can explainI am yours

See all


Me don't want problems, me don't want problems
Me don't want tricks, me don't want tricks
Me do want dollars, me do want dollars
Me want it big, me do want dollars
Me don't want problems, we ride Impalas
Me don't want tricks, me don't want tricks
Me do want dollars, me don't want tricks
Levitate, levitate, levitate, levitate

Young Egypt
Look, look
I feel like Pacino in Godfather, I'm charged
Our father who art in Heaven, Kendrick at large
Came in the game with a plan of beatin' the odds
What an accomplishment, broken promises
Kept my focus anonymous 'til I dealt with the consequence
The greatest and latest mogul, you know what time it is
You niggas fear me like y'all fear God
You sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of making your choice and writin' your bars
Before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital, avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies
With batteries to the head
The flattery of watchin' my stock rise
The salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
Just premium gas, do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
Black excellence, pessimist died countin' my coin
Hope it's evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better
I blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and Bimmers and blue leather
Forcasted my future, this is the future
The mastermind until my next album, more power to youCome onThis is a fifteen minute song
We're just jammin' out, we on stage
Taz, we just jammin' out
Hundred thousand
Hundred thousand, you gotta see it!
Look, look, look, go back to the down note

We gonna lay that shit
We gonna lay that shit, and watch what it's gon' do 
Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me down honeyTwo tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely have patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn't hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrowWhy so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me down honeyMy home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don't give a damn
Intuition she got a broke bitch wishin'
She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, of hoping you could make it
Bitches don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
If yan't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But shit, ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all themWhy so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me down honeyI wrote this song looking at a broke home baby
You know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and babies
Somebody yell "Kendrick American, they sho' is crazy"
And I said "why?"
Then he looked me in the eye, and said "nigga you fucked up"
You're banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
You never been through shit, you're crying hysterical
You settle for everything, complain about everything
You say you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ain't shit, I live in a hut bitch
I'm living to keep warm, you living to pay rent
I paid my way through, praying to Allah
You played your way through, by living in sci-fi
Bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing goes for the ones you came with
When y'all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you're looking for dope
These days ain't no compromise
And your pain ain't mines half the time
A brand new excuse ain't shit to me
Bitch I made my moves, with shackled feet
Cape TownIn today's day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
You wait on them, him and her
But when a blessing takes long, that's when you go wrong
You selfish motherfuckerWhy so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I'm down on my luck
And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it's breaking me down honeyPimp pimp hooray

Why so sad?

I love god, I love speed, I love drank, I love me
I love oceans in the deep
I love women, I love me
I love God
But I'm scared of god speed
Sometimes[Verse 3]
I wrote this song looking at a broke home baby
You know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and babies

Sounwave got a Grammy this year
Mack wop, bet he do what he want[Outro]
Level two, level two
No I'm not done
You ain't gotta tell me that I'm the one
I could put a rapper on life support
Guarantee something that none of you want
Ten homies down and they all serving life
Rent is like 2500 hundred a month
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?

Everything that's out this human being
I'm still growing
I'm a premature baby in this crazy life that we adore
Doors on the Lamborghini
I want 'em
Can't afford 'em so I tell the swap meet to clone 'em
I guess I really am a vanity slave
I guess my ancestors turning in their graves
Burning money when I get it
Fuck a life savings
Overdraft bank statements
Just to make a statement
When I put this fashion on
I'm a fashion junkie
Picking cotton in the country
I bought this out the country
Whips and chains, whips and chains
Jacob know my name
He call me Kunta
You my brother, we come from the same modern world
That's your girl, I see she rockin Fendi
Try this on
If it ain't upscale you may offend me
Coppin everything in sight
Ignorin they sacrifice
Amnesia if I see the black visa in my hand tonight
I show my dick and then I swipe
That's a punchline
That was hot and I want ice
That's ironic huhWord around town I'm all about the bitches
Word around town that I love me 26's
Word around town that I gotta stay paid
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
[Gucci Mane]
It's the Gucci, cock and shoot
Found my swag but lost my roof, burr
[Kendrick Lamar]
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
[Gucci Mane]
See my Audemar tick, that's my Audemar tock
[Kendrick Lamar]
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
Oh man videos got me wanting hoes
Appetite for flashing lights all I can do is pose
A black male on Melrose
I should get blackmailed by my people, hell rose
Niggas that ain't have shit
For 400 years overcompensate by over accessorizing with gear
Man, y'all don't see my vision
I do it for the love of hip hop and the love of bitches
Am I a hypocrite because everyday I'm contradicting
I think of how I'm living, then I watch how I'm living
I know this can't be right
My conscience tell me to stay righteous
It's unlikely to see what I what I like and say I don't like it
Biggest dilemma
My priorites ignoring me
I want to move accordingly but baby steps are premature, remember
I'm flying to the South and I'll be gone 'til November
To see my family tree but this a shame, I'm yelling out timberWord around town I'm all about the bitches
Word around town that I love me 26's
Word around town that I gotta stay paid
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
[Gucci Mane]
It's the Gucci, cock and shoot
Found my swag but lost my roof, burr
[Kendrick Lamar]
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
[Gucci Mane]
See my Audemar tick, that's my Audemar tock
[Kendrick Lamar]
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slaveCold, oh so cold
How ironic, he bought it then sold his soul
Is it masonic for your vice to take its toll
The remo (?) control is taking control
Lift up the doors
That lamborghini
I want to come with a dumbass model that invokes (?)
I like em both
I wife em both
Take these motherfucking jordans off, put on my loafs
Cause nothing goes bad every time I wear gucci
I'm getting more ass every time I wear gucci
They tell me it's a fad
Every time I wear gucci
But shit, I give a fuck when it bring me more coochie
This a young nigga's pedigree, I pray the lord can better me
If not, he bout to strike me down like this my third felony
The voices keep telling me,
Kendrick, don't forget about us
I burned my wardrobe hoping that I could live without it 
Look inside my eyes and tell me you see a warrior
I never felt the feeling of euphoria
Pain forever, prolong the pros and cons of prosperity is strong
Wake up in the morning and I gotta win
Not taking the victory, that's my only sin
And so I send a message to your messenger
A warning shot to let em know I'm serious
I'm ready for a war
When I roar it can break a glass window
The only thing for sure is the perfect way
To bend you on your back
Even if I gotta slither through the cracks
I can crack every code you deliver I attack
Every hole with a bomb squad sittin' on the tripod
Even if he try hard, he can still die hard
Run but you can't hide
White flags, you can pull 'em out fast
And tell me your last goodbyeI will, I will, climb the highest mountain
Before the flood comes
And all my fight is drowning in blood
What I gotta lose? What I gotta prove?
I guess, war is my loveMake sure your next move is slick
Your best move is nothing
You know I take risk, dark clouds, I love it
Cause I can hide in the mist
Hop out and crushin' every soldier you're with
So I'm 6 for 6
I'm sick with determination, I'll terminate ya quick
I lead the pack, I follow no rules, I see the traps
I know you're close to fallin' on your face
Unload, reload, hand me another case
Explode, explode
The fire of my eyes
Is waiting on your demise
I know you hope your help is close byI will, I will, climb the highest mountain
Before the flood comes
And all my fight is drowning in blood
What I gotta lose? What I gotta prove?
I guess, war is my love
War is my love
I guess, war is my love 
I'm around the bullshit like a matador
I'm used to the bullshit, it don't matter, boy
Corporate acquisitions, accumulations of wealth
Build with the gods and double knowledge of self
Entrepreneur visions, Moulin Rouge religion
That pussy make a weak nigga break down
So what you want, the cheese or the chicks'
You want the chicks but you want the cheese
A bitch gotta eat
I'm havin' the epiphany you niggas ain't shit to me
Worse than the scum in the slum I'm from
I'm a southside nigga, yeah I'm 'bout mine
You be that next nigga coroners come and outline
You ain't made of what I'm made of
You a bum nigga with a bum bitch
Your shoes come from Vegas
Counterfeit, fraudulent fakers

Penalized every ho nigga that have a scheme (what else?)
Guns in your video get you locked in a bing

Murder one become manslaughter as soon as they brought up
Charity work, parking tickets and no charges
Fuck nigga you fucked over your father when he gave you a dick
Should have been a bitch in pajamas
I made my first million fucking dollars
Bought a Bible, oh yeah, God got me
Made my second million dollars, bought a chopper and a binocular
I'm scared, this shit don't happen to everybody
I'm on Instagram looking at your favorite singer

When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You'll slip through the cracks hoping that you'll survive
Gather your wind, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterflyAt first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late night thinkin' of you
Until I got my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?When I get signed, homie I'mma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue eyed devil with a fat ass smokey
I'mma buy a brand new Caddy on fours
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce four
Platinum on everything, platinum on wedding ring
Married to the game, made a bad bitch yours
When I get signed homie I'mma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'mma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican, run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated but I got a million dollar check, like thatWe should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money go back home, money go back home
We should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money go back home, money go back homeAt first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late night thinkin' of you
Until I got my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?Yo what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keeping it, motherfuckerWhat you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anything, see, my name is Uncle Sam on your dollar
Motherfucker you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliche and say, fuck your haters
I can see the borrow in you
I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies with a snow white collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me feel forever baby, count it all together baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better baby
Your horoscope is a gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two c-notes
Too much and enough both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it Kendrick
And when you get the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-fiveLookin' down is quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top you got it)
A lot of metaphors, leavin' miracles metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mindWe should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money go back home, money go back home
We should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money go back home, money go back homeTax man comin' 
 
I woke up this morning with my dick on hard.
Didn't know why til' I said fuck all y'all
Or fuck this world, or I'ma that girl 
[Intro: The Sylvers & Kendrick Lamar]
Pillars of joy
Can be far out
Through the thought of you
I'll be troubled and bustled and scorned for your love
Canei Fitch on the beat
Turn the headphones up, Ali
Here we go![Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up this morning with my dick on hard
Didn't know why 'til I said fuck all y'all
Or fuck this world, or I'mma fuck that girl
Good Kid, m.A.A.d city watch my day unfurl
I put my life in these sentences
Fucking right it's either that or life sentences
I'm relatives with Benjamin
I used to give a fuck about my luck when I was innocent
Now what the fuck is up I'm at your neck like a pendleton
Nigga I need that bitch I need that
24 acres & a mule best believe that
They say he got smoked like where the weed at
And everything you hope bitch nigga we that
Pockets on Kelly Price back when it was '95
Buy a strap and then we cock it back when it's uncircumcised
Write a rap on how we just react when shotty hit the spine
Give you dap and then we slide through your hood 3 dozen times
So what's good I'm looking for a pedicure
Pink pussy that pop, preferably the kind that don't stink
Uhh, Bomb ass head uhh 'til she can't blink
And her eyes get watery you gotta pardon me[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm so damn turnt, wheelin' in a two door with two hoes that follow me
And you know Westside, right on time, tell 'em hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though
When my hood, getting to the money, the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto dawg but
Westside, right on time, only thing fosho
Eastside, right on time, gunnin' through your door uhh[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
I woke up this morning like fuck the world
Been hustlin' since I was 12, man I've been through hell
Now these motherfuckers is tryna' tell me I don't care
Trying to tell y'all muthafuckas look y'all wasn't there
Turn posted up on the block, waiting for mail
For my niggas posted up in the county, praying for bail
Could have cost your boy everything, man it wasn't cheap
Coming for a nigga just don't sleep, shit for the weak
Got on my Malcolm X frames, now I count the check mane
Cuz every time I speak you hear my Malcolm X pain
Now them doors go up on that Lamb, they like judo
Don't you like your bitches with an ass, I like you ho
First them bitches see me, I'm gone, I'm like pluto
Plus I keep them choppers that sing, they Mars Bruno
Brown bag full of cash baby, MCM
When they ask me my name I tell 'em MC him, straight up[Hook][Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
All praise go to the most high
All fades turn into a drive-by
Part ways from the streets, after fucking with police guaranteed
Last nigga that did that died -- don't you, don't you, don't you
Wanna live where the AK, go for only 8k
Minus 6 racks, minus one on top of that
Melee, stomp him out then drug him out like a date rape
Daytonas bending every corner while they say[Hook][Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
All I ever wanted was a dollar bill and hundreds
And my teacher as my woman, when she smiled I stick my tongue in
Plus some cartoons and some cereal, Snoop Doggy on my stereo
Some British Knights or LA Gears with glowing lights or Perry Ellis jacket
I would love a swapmeet full of Chevrolets in candy paint
That's wet with Tammy on the bumper, can I hump her? Poppa tell me yes
A DPGC concert and a DJ Quik song on cassette
Twenty years later, "Hi hater, I'm the fucking best"[Hook] 
 
 
Writer At WarKendrick Lamar in his own words.A lot of times in interviews, people ask me things like, "How does it feel now? What have you bought your mom and your pops and family?" Nobody ever really asks about what it's like trying to adapt to fame and money and how much of a depression it can make for you. How much of a depression it could put you in knowing that so many kids hang on to your words. I can't make a song like "i" without being in that dark place. "i" comes from going overseas, going to New York, being in L.A. and hearing kids saying, "Kendrick, I was gonna kill myself last week. Section.80, good kid, m.A.A.d city saved my life." Or "I was gonna kill myself tonight until I came to your show."
I believe that they are telling the truth. At first I wasn't so sure, maybe it was just they were excited to meet me. But then they showed me their wrists and had all these different scars from when they tried to take their lives but failed. Or I look into their eyes and their pupils are dilated and they on all these types of meds and drugs, it's a whole different story to me. That's when I learned that while I'm making music for myself, drawing from my own experiences and conflictions and battles within myself, this teenager listens to every word I say. And that's spooky
I think one of my biggest battles within myself is embracing leadership. You always grow up and you hate the term "role model." You would say, "I don't wanna be a role model. I don't want none of that." But in actuality, you are the biggest role model. It's impossible to fight the title of role model. Especially when the type of music I make is so personal. People feel like they can relate to me or that they are me. They feel like they know my whole life story even though we from different worlds. So when I go out and meet them in public, I don't get a response like, "Kendrick, will you sign this real quick?" Or, "I wanna just take this picture with you." No, they want to have full conversations. I find out that they live their lives by my music and that right there is something
[Kendrick Lamar's XXL Cover Story - Second Clip]When I try to soak it all in, that's the only thing that kind've scare me, feel me? Life is sad in general and I'm meeting these different people every day. It kind've snaps me back into reality outside of what I do. Outside of the girls, outside of the cars, the money, it really ain't that important when you meeting somebody that's still in the struggle. These the people that live their lives in dark spaces, every day , you know, and they use my music as some sort of tool to keep going, almost like a Bible, you know? These kids feel like they got nothing to believe in but they see me and say, "Kendrick, I believe in you. I believe in your music." And what happens it puts me in some type of space where it's almost like some type of worship or responsibility, but I know it. I can see it
Anything I say or do, I don't take back, I don't regret.I think one of my biggest assets is not knowing how famous I am. Or even excluding the word, I hate the word "famous." I'm aware of it. I know people treat me different because of it. And the more I am aware of that and play into it, the more I become detached from the real world. So it's really about balance. The more somebody opens the door for me and I walk through without acknowledging that they opened the door for me, the more I become separate from others
I had a talk with Lauryn Hill and she said, "Try to completely throw away your ego." How many times can you throw away an ego, you know? It's tough. It's something we all battle with. I battle with it all the time and the idea of being in all these placesâthe big spots, all the events, the lightsâit's all for your ego. It's all for your own confirmation to be like, okay, I'm somebody. But truthfully, you've always been somebody. You don't need the lightsI try to think about that. Also, I like to look at old pictures and think of things from back in the day that kind of draws me back to where I came from. I think a lot of times when artists are in so much of the now, they only think of what's ahead of them, which is cool. But I look at pictures of the small little apartment that I come from in Compton and things like that. And it always trips me out when I get too far out there where I'm missing phone calls or not responding to text messages on time or my peoples is hitting me, my moms is and I can't get back to her. Sometimes you on the go and you forget about those little things
It's definitely a gift and a curse when you make music as personal as I make it. Of course you get the kids out there that say that they relate to you and this song saved their lives, and you helped them with their assignment for this and that. And then at the same time, your privacy is not respected. And all entertainers go through it, but moreso the ones that make very personal music, because it's not just me you're focusing on now when I'm out in public, but also on individual characters that I'm talking about in my music. So that's a whole other ballgame and it's just something that I've gotta accept
When I'm completely drained of inspiration, that's when I'm finished with the project.I think the way it is, the positive aspect of me gaining more listeners and giving them some type of motivation and relatable effect, it's more than running from somebody snapping a picture of my mom's van that was on my album cover, that she actually still has. I'd never think that would happen, but it's happened plenty of times to where she has to hide the van now. She can't drive that thing no more. And she's old school, she wanna drive it. But I never want them to be in this type of world, because not everybody can handle it. I think the average person wouldn't be able to handle the day-to-day. It's a lot of things you gotta deal with. So me doing that, it's just a piece of me. I gotta find balance and try not to really get too frustrated over it
I'd be lying to you to say I knew good kid, m.A.A.d city would be as successful as it has been. In the beginning I was very doubtful. Once I was done, the jitters hit me so fast. I was so confident in making it, because I was like, "This is it, man. Nobody heard this story and if you heard it, you heard it in bits and pieces but I'm finna put it to you in a whole albumâfrom Compton, from the hood, from the streetsâit's a whole other perspective and light, I'ma go back and do the skits just like how Biggie and Dre and Snoop and 'Pac did it. And I'ma tell my story." Then I wrapped up with it and said, "Man, what's on the radio right now? I don't think they doin' skits and things like that." I don't know if the people are gonna understand what I'm talkin' about on this album because it's almost like a puzzle pieced together, and albums ain't been created like this in a long time. Albums that actually still reach the masses, at leastMy whole outlook on being signed was to have an actual massive commercial successful album. This is what you think as a kid. You don't know nothing about creative process and things like that. So I didn't know how blessed I was to actually go and make an album that I can create and control 100 percent. When I was done with it, I was like, "Man, these people believe in me like this? They let me just do this whole thing by myself like this? I don't know. Y'all sure I'm right?"
I was nervous because I didn't think the people would understand it. And I get a call from Pharrell. He said he had a copy of the album and it's amazing. And I was like, that call was right on time because that was when I was feeling super insecure about it. Pharrell said, "Never feel that way again. When that little negative man come behind your head, always follow your first heart, and that was your first heart, to put the album out like this." This is his words verbatim, he said, "Watch what's gonna happen."
I believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten.When I come up to certain artists, artists that I've always looked up to, and they can recite my records that wasn't the single, that puts me in a space where, okay, this is a person I always respect and to get their respect back was almost like confirmation for me. I always thought confirmation would be having a lot of money, and things I could do for my family
Because that was what we was taught when you come from these urban neighborhoods, you was taught that having money was success and that's all you see, all you know. So once I got the money and everything else that comes with it, I felt like I wasn't satisfied. I'm looking around like, this is great security, but I don't even spend it on myself, I spend it on my loved ones. That makes me feel good knowing I can support somebody that's in need. But at the same time, I'm feeling like, okay, what's after this? So what I realized was, my greatest fulfillment of accomplishment was having somebody that I looked up to for so many years and knowing that I put in that same dedication and work and them saying, "Thank you." And them being able to recite them lyrics
Kendrick Lamar - Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe ([Explicit)]I think the first time I played "Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe" for Andre 3000 was before it came out. I never share my album while I'm creating. I think that the situation with Andre was one of those things where he was in the studio with Dre and Dre was like, "Play some stuff ." I can't say no to Dr. Dre. But me creating music, I never really play music for anybody, even people inside the camp because it can almost sway your creative process 100 percent. So along with that, I cut off everything on the radio; I really just duck off from music. Because I'm gonna be influenced and I don't want to be. That has always been my process. I just feel like, it's really the only prized possession that I actually can control, you know? It's selfishness for sure, but it's my selfishness and I own it
I know a lot of people that go around and play music to get approval because some are not so confident in the things they do. But with me, personally, I can only speak for myself, this is me. Anything I say or do, I don't take back, I don't regret. That's how I was feeling at the time and that's how y'all gonna get it, and I own it. Love me or hate me, I own it. It is what it is. And that's how I look at it
From 13 years old to the time I was 21, I was in a mode of mastering how to be a rapper. Like a rapper's rapper, using my tongue as a sword, a fuckin' barbarian. That's all it was about, slaying words. So when I turned 21, 22, somewhere around there, I got into a mode where it became more of a writer aspect for me rather than just being a rapper 'cause this is around the same time where cats weren't putting out mixtapes anymore. They was putting out full bodies of work and wasn't even signed to a major label. So by that time, that's when I started developing and actually constructing my music from a writer's point of view. good kid, m.A.A.d city was probably one of them albums that you could unfold out into a book and read it. And that's how I treat everything. Everything is critical like that from here on out. It's the art of writing
So you ask yourself in the midnight hour, 'Who am I? Is this really what I'm supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What's my responsibility?'This is more than just music for me. This is actually a piece of me. I'm obsessed with it. And that's how I take it. When I make my music, it comes from a genuine space where I'm already spreading myself wide to the world. So during my process in creating it, that time is for me, personally. That's for my heart, those are my memories that helped me up with these lyrics and get inspiration. That was my memories. Taking those inspirations and going into that booth, that's something that I hold dear
When I'm completely drained of inspiration, that's when I'm finished with the project. When I start maybe trying to tamper with things that I shouldn't tamper with, I've already had done, that's when I'm done and I know I've exhausted inspiration. That comes with not wanting to actually rush the process. I always want to put it down to the last idea, and once I'm drawn away from it, that's when I say, okay, let's take all these piecesâthey might not even be songsâlet's take these pieces and construct it. So what I want to say, and how I want to execute it becomes clearIt's the best part because the things that I say on my recordsâthis is another reason why I don't just play records for peopleâyou won't necessarily get it until it's constructed. I know what type of artist I am. I'm not an artist that's gonna give you a single and say, "This is what my album's gonna sound like, go sell it." That's not me. I'm just not that artist to give you one or two songs here and there and run with it. Everybody has their own niche. With mine, I just own it, and I know that's exactly what that is. And I wanna keep that lane. I don't want to jump in somebody else's lane and try to do their moves because it may not work for me like it worked for them. So I stay where I feel like I'm inspired
What's crazy to me is that I feel the same energy now that I felt before my first album. I know there's lot of pressure for me on this new album but it don't necessarily scare me. It's almost confirmation, like, go in there and challenge yourself just the same way you challenged yourself the first time. Because I remember going to radio stations and them telling me this: "Dr. Dre had Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Eminem, you seen what Eminem did, right? Yeah, uh huh. Kendrick Lamar, he from the West Coast, and Compton, too. Dre from Compton, you see the legacy he left. Yeah, so I hope that album is good. Matter fact, you got the weight on your shoulders right now."
Thank you for that. Let me get in the studio now since you just put the battery in my back
[Kendrick Lamar Covers XXL Magazine's Winter 2014 Issue]I thought I was going to win Best Rap Album at the Grammys. I put a lot of work in on my album and the biggest thing for me is knowing that it was basically an underground album. It didn't have big No. 1 records on it and there wasn't really any commercial hits. It was great songs and I think the message behind it reached as many listeners and believers as a super mainstream album. So for me, when you're saying, "rap," that would be my definition of something that deserved an accolade. Yep
I found out a lot about myself in these past two years. It's scary. I know more about myself now than any other point of my life. I believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten. I was a pretty shy and to myself type of person as a kid. And now 15 years later I'm in front of people every day, tens of thousands of people. So that makes me more of a recluse. That makes me not come outside of my world on the outskirts of L.A. and bounce around different places and things like that
What I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place.So you ask yourself in the midnight hour, "Who am I? Is this really what I'm supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What's my responsibility?" It's a real trippy thing, you feel me? And I think it's something that nobody can understand; only an artist can. Things change for you with success when you get money. I noticed when people started treating me a little bit different, the people that I cared about the most, my close friends and family. The artist don't necessarily change, it's usually the people around them. Their expectations of you can sometimes be out of control. You can do one thing that can trigger something mentally in them that makes them think that you don't care about them or you don't fuck with them no more when that's not the case. You're just more focused on what you have to do because it's bigger
The moment I start seeing change in people around me, that's when I know something is a little bit different. Then there's tension in the air that I probably can't necessarily deal with at the moment. 'Cause when the industry don't understand me, and the business don't understand me, these are the people I can run to. What happens when I can't run to them?
Artists just get paranoid in any situation and circumstance. I'm always paranoid. I'm already a person who thinks a lot; sometimes I may overthink things or think too much. So when you're put into a space where you feel like you can't necessarily trust your close ones, that can do some whole other crazy thing to you psychologically. Seriously. All you got is you and God at the end of the day
The hard time for me was probably when I was on the road. It's almost like you go on the road and you're gone for two years. And this place you've known your whole life, these people you've known your whole life, everything is different when you come back. And you feel like, damn, your sanctuary is now on that tour bus. That dirty, stinky, smelly tour bus. And that's one thing, among numerous other things, that have been hard sometimes. To the point where people are pulling for you left and right, where you feel like you don't have control over your own life. Over your own well-being
What I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place. And I've seen and heard some of the greats go out because of it. And I'm saying this right now to let everyone know, it's real and you have to be mentally steady 100 percent in order to keep doing it at a high level and still maintain your sanity 
I return before tables get turned
It's my turn, spur of the moment
They re-produce my sperm and try to clone it, stand firm
Bumping The Firm, Phone Tap, I'm on it
I slaughter every opponent to bits of components, potent
You can't f-ck with the horse power, your woofing too much
Y'all bout to hoarse coward, as soon as I buss, pause
You put your hands on a broad and telling me you can brawl
You thought you saw me when you saw Saw, frightening
More reckless than a ? driving without a license
Hittin' your new truck then leaving you hiking
They said no, the industry let it go
I cracked the window then hit the back door like trick dices
Stickin' and movin and movin' and stickin' the prices
Uppin' the ante before my ante can promise you hear me clear
Even if you eat 3 ears with Tyson
Rippin' the panties but bootin' the wammys
They dyke and I'm liking them all, I'm siftin' through panties
Haters'll spike it
Voicing opinions but holding laryngitis
But I don't hear 'em, I'm a winner by law
Track em down like the subway when they sub-par
Sub-zero everytime I jump in the send the Gods,
Send the angels, send the God
I can make you look hard, I know
I just let the thoughts take its toll
More sentences than level four of y'all, Bogard
Go hard, black tar, concrete, Tom Vick times Papi Mason times 3
Uncle Toms need toms to stomach atomic bombs
Or die from my Wizardry
Rza, Gza, Method man
I'm a killer b, killer! Be killed, make your embassy yield
This is not your cup of tea, and oh
They say waters run deep, dive in, Bermuda triangles
And you will see us, we must leave dust behind
Emcee's duck, deduct, revenue declined
When we touch down like a Running Back's grind
Can you keep up and keep us safe for keepsake
That aint safe,
Compton!

New Kung Fu KennyThrow a steak off the yacht

Leave him in the wilderness
With a sworn nemesis, he'll make it
Take the gratitude from him
I bet he'll show you something, woah
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like bitch I did that x-rated
Johnny don't wanna go to school no more, no more
Johnny said books ain't cool no more (no more)
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America you know we all love him
Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head philosphin' on what the lord had done
He said, "K-Dot can you pray for me?
It's been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome"
He was lookin' for some closure
Hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him
"I can't sugar coat the answer for you
This is how I feelâif somebody kill my son
That mean somebody's gettin' killed"
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I wait in front a niggas spot and watch him hit his block
I'll catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I'll chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch I did that"
Ain't no black power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma
Touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece
Touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
Call you backAlright kids we're gonna talk about gun control
(Pray for me) DamnIt's not a place
This country is to be a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look aroundHail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag
Is wrapped and dragged with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders
Look what you taught us
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets
Wall street, corporate offices, banks
Employees and bosses with homicidal thoughts
Donald Trump's in office, we lost Barack
And promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you crippin' or you married to blood?
I'll ask againâoopsâaccident
It's nasty when you set us up
Then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera

Trials and tribulations, but I know God
Satan wanna put me in a bow-tie
Praying that the holy water don't go dry, yeah yeah
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But ain't no nigga never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found meAnd I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at the time, sun gone shine)Everybody looking at you crazy (Crazy)
What you gone do? (What you gone do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving (Keep moving)
Or let the paranoia haunt you? (Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police I wear my heart
On my sleeve let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
Fuck do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times our potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise thisAnd I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at the time, sun gone shine)They wanna say there's a war outside and a bomb in the street
And a gun in the hood and a mob of police
And a rock on the corner and a line full of fiends
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme, yup
These days of frustration keep y'all on tucking rotation
I duck these gold faces, post up fee-fi-fo-fum bases
Dreams of realities peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
The sky can fall down, the wind can cry now
The strong in me, I still smileI love myself
(The world is a ghetto with guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at the time, sun gone shine)Walk my barefeet (Walk my barefeet)
Down, down valley peak (Down, down valley peak)
I keep my fee-fi-fo-fum (Fee-fi-fo-fum)
I keep my heart undone (My heart undone)And I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at the time, sun gone shine)I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'mma do it 'til I get it right
I went to war last night
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', l can never see the message
I can never take the lead, I can never bob and weave
For my nigga that be letting 'em alienate me
And the sound is moving in a meteor speed
From a 100 to a billion lay my body in the street
Keep my money in the ceiling let my mama know I'm free
Give my story to the children and the lesson they can read
And the glory to the feeling of all of y'all scenes
Seen enough, make a motherfucker scream, "I love myself!"I lost my head, I must've misread what the good book said
Oh woes keep me, it's a jungle inside
Give myself again 'til the well runs dry 
Loving you is complicatedI place blame when you still
Place shame when you steal
Feel like you ain't shit
Feel like you don't feel, confidence in yourself
Breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit I'm convinced your talent's nothin' special
What can I blame him for
Nigga I can name several
Situation had stopped with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager where's your patience
Where was your antennas
Where was the influence you speak of
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure you ain't no leader
I never liked you, forever despise you I don't need you
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
I fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace itI swear loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicatedLovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, one hundred proof
I can feel you vibin', recognize that your ashamed of me
Yes I hate you tooHouse keeping
Â¡Abre la puerta! Â¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!
Â¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuartoÂ¡
!Disculpe!Are you the reason why mama and them leavin'
No you ain't shit, you say you love them, I know you don't mean it
I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence, where was your support that you pretend?
You ain't no brother, you ain't no disciple, you ain't no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit or leave his best friend
Little brother, you promised you'd watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas, on the road, bottles and bitches
You faced time the one time, that's unforgiven
You even faced time instead of a hospital visit
You should thought he would recover, well
The surgery couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say "you fuckin' failed"
You ain't tryI know your secrets nigga
Mood swings is frequent nigga
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin' nigga
Y'all damn near beefin', I seen it and your the reason nigga
And if this bottle could talk I cry myself to sleep
Bitch everything is your fault
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know your secrets
Don't let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin'
And that time you I'm bout to hurl
I'm fucked up, but I'm not as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
Shoulda killed yo ass a long time ago
You shoulda filled that black revolver blast a long time ago
And if those mirrors could talk it would say "you gotta go"
And if I told your secrets
The world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness
